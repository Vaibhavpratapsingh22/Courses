# Chapter - 5 Articles 
LinkedIn gives you the ability to write articles to share on your page. You have the freedom to write whatever you want, whenever you want. It can be about your experiences, your knowledge in an area, or a professional opinion you would like to express. What you may not know is that writing LinkedIn articles is important for personal branding. By creating a piece of writing that is unique to you and your profession/business, you are branding yourself. Your words become attached to your job and then promote your business.

When you write LinkedIn articles, you are writing as a professional. People will read what YOU have to say about YOUR area of expertise. Anything you write or post will connect to you and your place of business/brand. Therefore, by producing high quality LinkedIn articles that inform and explain your expert knowledge, users are able to trust you. 

You can write on any topic for example “5 best interview questions” or explain “the benefits of Snapchat for a business,” use your business title to prove you know what you are talking about. Of course, be sure that the information you share is relevant. If you write an article on something so specialized that only your coworkers will know, it could lack the engagement you seek. Find relevant subjects that will draw in your target audience and share important material with them. You will gain trust once you have given quality information that can benefit them.

## Tips 
These are some tips that can help improve the quality and quantity of your written material:

### 1. Write a Head-Turning Headline
 The headline determines whether audiences will read the rest of your work. If the headline doesn’t spark interest, stir an emotion or make the reader want to learn more about the topic, you simply won’t achieve the desired results with your content.

### 2. Create a Hook That Grabs Their Attention
 You have three seconds to keep readers hooked after the headline. The first sentence also plays a role in determining whether they read the rest of your content. As a result, it should capture the reader’s attention and smoothly lead them into your first point.

### 3. Do Your Research
 You must have extensive knowledge on the topic you’re writing about. Include statistics, data and metrics to establish credibility and support your claims.

### 4. Focus on a Single Purpose
 You should identify at least one key message you’d like to convey before you create your content. Keep this in mind when writing and tie your content back to the main point as much as possible.

### 5. Write in a Unique Voice
 The content you publish is the voice of your company and it should be unique to your company’s personality. It’s important to align the tone of your writing to your target audience, business goals and brand persona.

### 6. Optimize Digital Content
 The best digital content often consists of short paragraphs, short sentences and bulleted lists. Digital content should also be optimized for search using SEO best practices and the latest SEO content strategies.

### 7. Edit Your Work
 After you have created a first draft, go back and consider how you might polish the rough edges of your writing. In most cases, writing improves as it goes through a round or two of edits—even when it has been drafted by experienced content creators.

## Before You Publish, Remember This:
1. Include a relevant sub-headline as an add-on to the title. It helps to give a glimpse into the idea of the article even before reading the first sentence.

2. Don’t forget to use strong images to emphasize major points. Unsplash, Pexels, and Moose are great sources for free stock imagery. Be sure to credit the photographers of the image.

3. If possible, consider using quotes. Incorporate the words of influential people to substantiate your points. This will also bring more highlights and the chances for the sharing of your article.

4. Use hyperlinks to other articles, writers, and content from around the internet. Make sure external links are providing more context to your ideas and not just a shameless plug for your other works.

Worst or not efficient time to post on linkedin are:

3. Outside of business hours. Most of the people tend to switch from professional social media platforms to more personal ones after work hours.
