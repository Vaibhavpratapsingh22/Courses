# Chapter - 5 Articles 
LinkedIn gives you the ability to write articles to share on your page. You have the freedom to write whatever you want, whenever you want. It can be about your experiences, your knowledge in an area, or a professional opinion you would like to express. What you may not know is that writing LinkedIn articles is important for personal branding. By creating a piece of writing that is unique to you and your profession/business, you are branding yourself. Your words become attached to your job and then promote your business.

When you write LinkedIn articles, you are writing as a professional. People will read what YOU have to say about YOUR area of expertise. Anything you write or post will connect to you and your place of business/brand. Therefore, by producing high quality LinkedIn articles that inform and explain your expert knowledge, users are able to trust you. 

You can write on any topic for example “5 best interview questions” or explain “the benefits of Snapchat for a business,” use your business title to prove you know what you are talking about. Of course, be sure that the information you share is relevant. If you write an article on something so specialized that only your coworkers will know, it could lack the engagement you seek. Find relevant subjects that will draw in your target audience and share important material with them. You will gain trust once you have given quality information that can benefit them.

## Writing a Healthy Article
These are some tips that can help improve the quality and quantity of your written material:

### 1. Write a Head-Turning Headline
 The headline determines whether audiences will read the rest of your work. If the headline doesn’t spark interest, stir an emotion or make the reader want to learn more about the topic, you simply won’t achieve the desired results with your content.

### 2. Create a Hook That Grabs Their Attention
 You have three seconds to keep readers hooked after the headline. The first sentence also plays a role in determining whether they read the rest of your content. As a result, it should capture the reader’s attention and smoothly lead them into your first point.

### 3. Do Your Research
 You must have extensive knowledge on the topic you’re writing about. Include statistics, data and metrics to establish credibility and support your claims.

### 4. Focus on a Single Purpose
 You should identify at least one key message you’d like to convey before you create your content. Keep this in mind when writing and tie your content back to the main point as much as possible.

### 5. Write in a Unique Voice
 The content you publish is the voice of your company and it should be unique to your company’s personality. It’s important to align the tone of your writing to your target audience, business goals and brand persona.

### 6. Optimize Digital Content
 The best digital content often consists of short paragraphs, short sentences and bulleted lists. Digital content should also be optimized for search using SEO best practices and the latest SEO content strategies.

### 7. Edit Your Work
 After you have created a first draft, go back and consider how you might polish the rough edges of your writing. In most cases, writing improves as it goes through a round or two of edits—even when it has been drafted by experienced content creators.

## Before You Publish Article, Remember This

1. Include a relevant sub-headline as an add-on to the title. It helps to give a glimpse into the idea of the article even before reading the first sentence.

2. Don’t forget to use strong images to emphasize major points. Unsplash, and Moose are great sources for free stock imagery. Be sure to credit the photographers of the image.

3. If possible, consider using quotes. Incorporate the words of influential people to substantiate your points. This will also bring more highlights and the chances for the sharing of your article.

4. Use hyperlinks to other articles, writers, and content from around the internet. Make sure external links are providing more context to your ideas and not just a shameless plug for your other works.

## Best and Worst Time To Post Your Article
You must post your article in the perfect time slot i.e when most of the users are active on LinkedIn. Below are the best and the worst time slots to post:

### Best or time to get best outcome of your work
 1. Work-Hours, 10 A.M to 6 P.M. 
 Interaction with LinkedIn has been seen in the first half of the office hours when people cruise through the network to look for new research, opinions, inspiration, before indulging in their own work.

 2. Office Commute hour, 7 A.M to 9 A.M and 6 P.M to 8 P.M 
  Well, that’s not surprising, people turn to see their LinkedIn feed while traveling to work in the early morning or winding up their workday and coming back home.

### Worst or not efficient time to post on linkedin are

1. Weekends are the worst days to post on LinkedIn. The majority of your audience will be out, socializing with the real world, or spending time with their families. So it is important to schedule your posts for weekdays mostly.

2. Monday showed very little engagement as compared to other weekdays. It makes sense that due to catch-up and weekly-plan meetings on Monday, people would hardly get the time to check their feeds.

3. Outside of business hours. Most of the people tend to switch from professional social media platforms to more personal ones after work hours.

## Engagement 
Engagement simply means to spread your content more and more. Below are some ways by which you can make that happen:

### 1. Share Your LinkedIn Articles with Your Knowns

 Your knowns play a very important role in making your article go viral as they will read the article properly, will add comments and like, there is also a chance of sharing the article. So, you must send them.
 
 Think through who in your contacts would genuinely benefit from the knowledge and information you shared in your post. Then send them a personalized message with a link.

 Something like:

 “Good morning/afternoon, [First Name]! I just wrote an article about how to get more views on LinkedIn Publishing posts, and I know this is something you had mentioned you are exploring. I hope you find it useful and would love to know your thoughts if you have a minute. Thanks!”

### 2. Share with LinkedIn Groups
The most effective way to share your LinkedIn articles within a group will be to copy the link from the “share” button and then write a post specific to each group that includes the link.

### 3. Share with Other Social Media and/or Email
This one is a tricky one, as it depends on your bigger picture social media strategy and goals. If you are repurposing your own blog content as LinkedIn articles, then you may prefer to send them to the original source on your website rather than your LinkedIn profile.

If, however, you have not shared the same content in another way with your email list or other social media accounts, then share on! Follow all the same guidelines to personalize and customize.

### 4. Engage with Your Readers on LinkedIn
 You can get more readers by rewarding the ones you have! LinkedIn will show you who has liked your article, how many views it has received, and any comments on the article.

If you see that someone liked your article and you feel like it is appropriate to the relationship you might follow up with an individual message. Something along the lines of “I see that you liked my article about ____. Have you been using ___ in your business lately? What kind of results are you seeing?”

Definitely take the time to respond to any comments with a comment of your own. At a minimum, thank readers for taking the time to comment, and if possible, keep the conversation going with engagement strategies.

### 5. Be Aware of Search Optimization Best Practices
Are you still not seeing the number of readers you would like on your articles? Maybe the way you wrote the article itself needs to be evaluated.

Think through who it is that you want to read this article, and what they are searching for, or what frustration they are having. Do you answer their questions? Do you solve their problem?

## Summary
At the end I can say that, you can connect with everyone who comments or engages with your article. Do the same for those who comment/engage with posts from other experts in your niche. You can also search LinkedIn for relevant groups to join, participate in discussions there, and connect with everyone you talk to or engage with by sharing your article there.
