# Chapter - 4 Posting 
Publishing valuable content on LinkedIn positions you as an authority on your topic. Posting regular, valuable content creates trust with your connections and helps you to be seen as an expert on your topic. Those who are seen as an expert in their area are often paid more and get more business. LinkedIn is about relationship building and one of the best ways to build a relationship with your connections is by providing value first – which you can do with your content.

If you use custom graphics or images, you have the additional benefit of adding a visual element to your profile as your three most recent posts on LinkedIn are part of your profile.

Every time your connections interact with your post (likes, comments and shares), it becomes visible to their first degree connections. This is very powerful as not only does this broaden the amount of people who see your post but it also has the benefit of being viewed as worthy of engagement by their connection.

## Tips For Posting Content

### 1. Post Different Content Types

 a) **Long story short**: Online content is about emotions and personal stories, not advertising. Users don't read but scan it, looking for something that would reflect their inner world at that very moment - when they scroll a news-feed. LinkedIn is about business, so brand storytelling is what you need to master here.

b) **Case studies, research, your industry news**: They build awareness and trust, turning your company page into a reliable information source.

c) **How-to and list-style tips**: They perform best on LinkedIn and get more likes and comments than other post types here.

d) **Company updates**: Let people know what's in there for them and how your new features will help them succeed.

### 2. Structure Your Posts Like a Boss
Given that reading online is 25% slower than in print and attention span becomes shorter and shorter every day, be careful when structuring your LinkedIn posts.

First of all, focus at the very beginning and narrow your thought to the maximum. The golden rule here is "one post = one thesis." Also, make the first sentence of your post eyebrow-raising: write something that would create a wow-effect and encourage readers to click on "See more" for further details.

**Note**: Write LinkedIn posts in the first person. "I" and "we" do wonders, making you sound like a real person talking to real people. It builds a personal connection with the audience and makes your posts compelling and inviting.

### 3. Add Some ‘Visual’ Factor To Your Posts
I bet you know that most people are visual beings, so they engage more when a social media post includes an image. It works with all platforms but LinkedIn. Text-only posts perform best here.

Yes, LinkedIn users are more readers than viewers, but it doesn't mean you can't grab their attention with visuals.Say no to memes and hyper-creativity. Instead, illustrate your LinkedIn posts with:

a) **Charts and diagrams**: They are perfect visuals to add when talking about case studies, trends, numbers, and updates:

b) **Faces**: It's nothing but human psychology: we are instinctively drawn to look at faces, and that is why images of people work so well. Sure enough, it's about posting experts in your niche or real people, relevant to the context of your LinkedIn posts.

### 4. Hashtags
Use hashtags, as the algorithm uses many intent signals to rank content, including hashtags "Pete Davies( LinkedIn’s Senior Director) says he recommends using hashtags, but to keep the number of hashtags included in a post at three or less". So if you have been hashtag bombing your posts, please stop that – it isn’t helping you and it’s possibly hurting your performance.

### 5.  Questions

Always ask for the opinion of others with in your post to encourage conversation as all social platforms weight comments as one of the highest indicators of engagement, except YouTub but for the rest of the landscape including LinkedIn you will find that the content that gets the most comments has the highest about of viewership and tends to live longer on the news feed. So a simple was to do this is by asking your audience their thoughts and it can be a simple “do you agree or disagree”?.

###  Before You Hit "Publish"
Consider this checklist every time you plan publishing a status update on LinkedIn:

1. Content maybe an informative or educational blog post, a how-to guide, data-driven research on the latest trends in your niche, a case study, your company news or updates.

5. You are on LinkedIn to grow professionally and help followers grow with you.
6. Check the hashtags are specific to the topic you are talking about in the post.
