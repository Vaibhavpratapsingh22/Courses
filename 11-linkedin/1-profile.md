# Chapter - 1 Profile
LinkedIn is a social network specifically designed for career and business professionals to connect. Over 65 million professionals use LinkedIn to cultivate their careers and businesses. Unlike other social networks in which you might become "friends" with anyone and everyone, LinkedIn is about building strategic relationships. Thus, the number of connections is less important than the type of connections. In fact, LinkedIn stops showing your actual number of connections once you have 500 because it's about quality, not quantity. Let's start with adding a profile and background picture. 

## Profile URL
Before heading towards the profile picture, let us first fic the URL. When you first sign up for LinkedIn, it will assign you a generic URL this is your name, dashes and numbers. It’s impossible to remember or share easily. Luckily, you can change it with just a few clicks and keystrokes.

Use your first and last name, or you can use a URL that you have used elsewhere, such as your Facebook personal profile. Just choose something that uses your name and is easy to remember. That’s the main point of the vanity URL—it gives people something easy to remember. 

LinkedIn lets you change it at any time, but pick something good and stick with it. Whenever you change your URL, you’ll lose people who have you bookmarked.

## Adding Profile and Background Picture
Your profile picture is very important because on the basis of your profile picture people will want to connect to you or offer you business proposals or maybe offer you a job. Now, if you don't have a profile picture or if it's outdated than you really have to work on that. What do you need to have a good profile picture? Well, first thing is that is has to be close up. Look into the camera, smile, have a neutral background and dress appropriately, wearing minimal jewellery and accessories and certainly no head-wear or no sunglasses.\
These are things to avoid in your profile picture like shades, bad lightning etc.\
So how do you know that your profile picture is good? You could ask colleagues or maybe friends or family members and make changes according to their response and reaction on the picture. Below shown pictures shows different poses that you can put in you profile and did you note one thing common in all pictures except suit? The smile, smile creates a very good impact on the viewer on your profile.

For the background image you can put any image of good quality which defines you or your profession. You can search on google and can easily find one. Maybe, like in the picture below:

##  Headline
Your headline is the line of text directly beneath your name on your profile. LinkedIn gives you about 120 characters of space here to tell visitors who you are and what you offer.

Your headline should be a combination of LinkedIn SEO keywords and compelling copy. That’s because it works to both attract traffic and keep users engaged with your profile.

You want to be uber clear about what you do. This is not a space for witty taglines like “Probably out fishing’” or “I rank it, you bank it!” Not only do headlines like these not include keywords, but they can leave profile visitors feeling confused about what exactly it is that you do.

I suggest either keeping your headline chocked full of keywords, with a bit of finessing copy (“I’m a digital marketing strategist that help small businesses reach more customers online.”) or taking the time to craft a compelling headline with conversion copywriting.

In the example above, this business owner is straight to the point by simply listing what her job title is and the services she offers. This is fine. It includes proper keywords that could potentially draw in people that are looking for services like hers.

## Summary
Writing a great LinkedIn profile top-to-bottom is the easiest way to set yourself apart from half-a-billion other LinkedIn users. Even if you’re uploaded a great profile photo, customized your headline, and detailed your work and education history, leaving the summary blank is a huge missed opportunity for a number of reasons. The LinkedIn profile summary is one of the first things people see when they visit your profile. 

Below is the example of a good summary:

###  What NOT To Do
 1. **Don’t recite your resume** like,
My first job out of college was at Pinkberry where I worked for two years until I went to Chase Bank for three… That’s when the insurance world called, where I worked for Geico, Progressive and now State Farm, where I sell auto and life. Btw, interested??

2. **Don’t confuse your LinkedIn summary with your unabridged biography** like, I was born to a family of five, in a poor section of the Bronx. I was a bottle baby from the start, undersized, underfed, and underwhelming. As the middle child, I had a minor birth defect — a mole above my right eye that screamed ‘everyone, please keep away.’ But now I just write seemingly unending LinkedIn summaries to handle that for me.

3. **Don’t talk about yourself in the third person** like, Carl Spackler is a detailed-oriented groundskeeper at Bushwood Country Club, who stays dedicated to manicuring the greens and believes in making true one-on-one connections with the people he speaks to.

4. **Don’t overdo the keywords** like, Accomplished technology professional who can lead business development, software design and contract management efforts. I’m also a customer-success driven sales executive with experience in enterprise data management solutions, cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS), and product management.

## Experience
The objective of the Experience Section of your LinkedIn Profile is to give visitors to your profile information about your past & current positions. In this section you can add your projects, the jobs that you have done earlier and where are you currently working.

## Education 
The education section should contain all your academic qualifications and the time period in which you have completed. You can add the school from where you have completed your high school and also add tour CGPA along with it. Then add your graduation college name with the CGPA and so on. 

## Skills and Endorsements
Including specific skills on your LinkedIn profile is a great way to showcase your abilities to other members. You can add a maximum of 50 skills to your profile. They're a simple and effective way of building your professional brand and engaging your network.

Once you've added a skill to your profile, your skills can be validated by 1st-degree(1st-degree LinkedIn connections are with  People you're directly connected to because you have accepted their invitation to connect, or vice-versa. You'll see a 1st degree icon next to their name in search results and on their profile) connections to reinforce their weighting. These are called **skill endorsements**, which are different than recommendations. When a connection endorses your skills, it contributes to the strength of your profile, and increases the likelihood that you'll be discovered for opportunities related to the skills you possess.

You don't need to request a skill endorsement in order to receive one. By default, you'll receive a notification when a connection endorses one of your skills. However, you can manage the frequency of the skill endorsement notifications.

##  Accomplishments
Accomplishments help the viewer to know about you in terms of work that you have done in past years. So in this section you can add the projects that you have completed and what was your position in that project. You can add the languages you know, blogs that you have written, honors and awards that you have achieved along with your studies. 

## Interests
Your interests must be listed professionally. So, pay attention to that fine line which divides your professional interests and personal hobbies.

For example, you may love traveling, reading books, listening to music, or horse riding, but when it comes to adding LinkedIn interests, you should choose those appropriate to your job role or education. They should reflect on how you want to be seen by your target recruiters.



## Featured
The Featured section allows you to showcase samples of your work to people who view your LinkedIn profile. This section is located toward the top of your profile between the About section and Activity section.

<p text align="center"><img src="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/options-for-adding-work-to-linkedin-featured-section-700.png"></p>

### Posts
If you select the Posts option from the drop-down menu shown above, you can flag a recently posted LinkedIn update to your timeline as a featured post. LinkedIn will bring up your most recent posts for you to choose from. Scroll through this list to find a post you’d like to feature. You can see the social proof on each post before making a selection.
### Articles
If you select the option to feature an article on your profile, you can choose from the library of articles you’ve published on LinkedIn previously. Similar to featuring a post, you must have already published a LinkedIn article before you can use this option.
### Links 
When you add a link to your Featured section, you’ll be linking out to a third-party web page. This can be handy for showcasing specific products or services, portfolio pages, spotlights on your brand done by other sites, and more. You can also include a link to a video, which can be a great option if you have a YouTube channel you want to feature. You can get really creative with what types of pages you want to use here.
### Media
If you want to feature specific imagery, PDFs, or other documents, you can do so using the fourth option: Media. This is a wonderful way to highlight a presentation or graphic element that you’ve worked hard on. And while not as visual, you can also feature longer written documents, which could be ideal for showcasing your copywriting skills or even a thesis.
