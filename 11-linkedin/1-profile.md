# Chapter - 1 Profile
LinkedIn is a social network specifically designed for career and business professionals to connect. Over 65 million professionals use LinkedIn to cultivate their careers and businesses. Unlike other social networks in which you might become "friends" with anyone and everyone, LinkedIn is about building strategic relationships. Thus, the number of connections is less important than the type of connections. In fact, LinkedIn stops showing your actual number of connections once you have 500 because it's about quality, not quantity. 


##  Picture And Cover
Your profile picture is very important because on the basis of your profile picture people will want to connect to you or offer you business proposals or maybe offer you a job. Now, if you don't have a profile picture or if it's outdated than you really have to work on that. What do you need to have a good profile picture? Well, first thing is that is has to be close up. Look into the camera, smile, have a neutral background and dress appropriately, wearing minimal jewellery and accessories and certainly no head-wear or no sunglasses.\
These are things to avoid in your profile
picture like shades, bad lightning etc.\
So how do you know that your profile picture is good? You could ask colleagues or maybe friends or family members and make changes according to their response and reaction on the picture.

##  Headline
Your headline is the piece of text that comes below your name and you have to see that as an ad as the tile of an ad. It is the thing which will attract people to read open your profile and read about you.
So there's a simple rule that you can use to enhance to make your title better on Linkedin.The rule is **Job title + Company name + most important keywords + Zing factor**. Now let me explain that, of course you have your job title and then your company name but it's also very important to ad the important keywords. Now why is that? Because when people go on Linkedin they often try to find certain profiles. They use the search option to find certain profiles and they search for a keyword like sales executive.So if you have this keyword in your headline the serch will show you to the people. Now comes the Zing factor, that's something that surprises people, that could be a conversation starter, that explains a little bit more what you stand for. 

## Summary

## Experience
The objective of the Experience Section of your LinkedIn Profile is to give visitors to your profile information about your past & current positions. In this section you can add your projects, the jobs that you have done earlier and where are you currently working.

## Education 
The education section should contain all your academic qualifications and the time period in which you have completed. You can add the school from where you have completed your high school and also add tour CGPA along with it. Then add your graduation college name with the CGPA and so on. 

## Skills and Endorsements
Including specific skills on your LinkedIn profile is a great way to showcase your abilities to other members. You can add a maximum of 50 skills to your profile. They're a simple and effective way of building your professional brand and engaging your network.

Once you've added a skill to your profile, your skills can be validated by 1st-degree(1st-degree LinkedIn connections are with  People you're directly connected to because you have accepted their invitation to connect, or vice-versa. You'll see a 1st degree icon next to their name in search results and on their profile) connections to reinforce their weighting. These are called **skill endorsements**, which are different than recommendations. When a connection endorses your skills, it contributes to the strength of your profile, and increases the likelihood that you'll be discovered for opportunities related to the skills you possess.

You don't need to request a skill endorsement in order to receive one. By default, you'll receive a notification when a connection endorses one of your skills. However, you can manage the frequency of the skill endorsement notifications.

### Posts
If you select the Posts option from the drop-down menu shown above, you can flag a recently posted LinkedIn update to your timeline as a featured post. LinkedIn will bring up your most recent posts for you to choose from. Scroll through this list to find a post you’d like to feature. You can see the social proof on each post before making a selection.

### Articles
If you select the option to feature an article on your profile, you can choose from the library of articles you’ve published on LinkedIn previously. Similar to featuring a post, you must have already published a LinkedIn article before you can use this option.

### Links 
When you add a link to your Featured section, you’ll be linking out to a third-party web page. This can be handy for showcasing specific products or services, portfolio pages, spotlights on your brand done by other sites, and more. You can also include a link to a video, which can be a great option if you have a YouTube channel you want to feature. You can get really creative with what types of pages you want to use here.

### Media
If you want to feature specific imagery, PDFs, or other documents, you can do so using the fourth option: Media. This is a wonderful way to highlight a presentation or graphic element that you’ve worked hard on. And while not as visual, you can also feature longer written documents, which could be ideal for showcasing your copywriting skills or even a thesis.
