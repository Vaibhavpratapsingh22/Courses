# Chapter - 3 Recommendations
In the old days, people would ask for a cover letter and a recommendation letter attached to your resume. But now you can just share your Linkedin profile, and they have all the information needed at hand. 
A recommendation is a statement that is written by a LinkedIn member to recognize or commend a connection, such as a colleague, business partner, or student. People who view your profile will often read the recommendations you've received from your connections to see what others have to say about your work.

LinkedIn is more than just a place where you find opportunities; it’s a place where opportunities find you. For that to happen you have to put yourself out there (completing your LinkedIn Profile, sharing content, engaging with your network, etc.), and make sure you’re putting your best foot forward. Including endorsements and recommendations in your Profile is a great way to complement and confirm the skills and experiences you’ve listed while also catching the eye of potentially interested professional parties.

## Importance 
A well-done recommendation should describe and give specific examples, whether they reflect someone’s ability to excel under pressure, act as a compassionate leader, succeed as a collaborative team-member or business partner. For recruiters, future hires or potential business partners, such a recommendation provides an important sign that this connection could be the person they are looking for.

If you’re the one looking to receive recommendations, always begin by identifying the people who know you well and who can best speak to your aptitude for excelling in a particular professional domain, attest to your leadership or management skills or shed light on some of your best accomplishments.

You can give and get LinkedIn recommendations from people more senior than you, more junior than you, at your same level, etc. There are no rules. I’d aim for having a variety on your profile – for example, one former boss, one former colleague, and maybe someone you trained/mentored/led. 

## Recommendation Tips 
These are some tips that you can keep in mind while writing a recommendation for your knowns: 
### 1. Explain the nature of your  relationship
That sounds really serious, but it's simply a helpful piece of context that acts as an "intro" for your recommendation. Whether it's a coworker you've worked closely with for years, a manager, a direct report, a point of contact at an agency, or something else entirely, it sets the stage for the reader to learn why you're writing this recommendation.

### 2. Provide details of the position for which you're recommending the person
Are you recommending this person for their work in one position? Or are you writing about their work across multiple jobs they've held while you worked with them? Either way, a great next step is to explain some of the notable parts of their job(s). It may feel strange -- kind of like you're listing out their job description. But this is very helpful for anyone reading the recommendation, looking to get a feel for what precisely it is they did in their job. 

### 3. Indicate how their contribution helped grow the team or company
This could be an explanation of how their performance helped hit hard metrics, or it could demonstrate a contribution toward more esoteric things, like leading their teammates or fostering new initiatives.

### 4. Explain what these achievements reveal about that person
By now, you've included some specifics -- so let's explain what those specifics mean for the larger theme of your recommendation. Do the examples you've detailed reveal that person is hard-working? Ambitious? Great for team morale? Connect their accomplishments with their attributes.

### 5.  End with a note about the personal aspect of working with him/her
In this section, hit the message home with a mention of how you felt working with the person, your hopes for their career, or simply a prediction about their future.

## Recommendation Templates
Recommendation templates are divided into two parts:
1. Asking for a recommendation

2. Writing a recommendation for someone

### 1. Requesting for a recommendation

1. “Hi[NAME]. I’m working on improving my LinkedIn profile and one of my goals is to get a couple of recommendations from colleagues that know my work well. Would you be able to write me a LinkedIn recommendation in the next couple of days to help me improve my profile? I could do the same for you if you’d like, just let me know.”

2. [NAME], would you kindly write me a LinkedIn recommendation based on the time we worked together as [ROLE]?

3. Hey, [NAME]! Long time no see. Would you kindly write a recommendation about the time we went to [SCHOOL]?

### 2. Writing a recommendation for someone

1. “[DESCRIPTIVE PHRASE] is what comes to mind when I think about [NAME]. I’ve had the pleasure of knowing [NAME] for [LENGTH OF TIME], during which [DESCRIPTION OF WORKING RELATIONSHIP]. Above all, I was impressed with [NAME’s] ability to [DESCRIPTION OF WHAT MAKES THEM STAND OUT]. And, of course, his/her [PERSONALITY TRAIT. [NAME] would be a true asset for any positions requiring [1-2 SKILLS NEEDED FOR THE POSITION] and its without hesitation that I recommend [NAME].”

2. I've worked for [NAME] for [TIME-PERIOD], and in those [TIME-PERIOD] years, I've seen her quickly take on new responsibilities while having the time to teach this information back into his/her friends or employees. [NAME] is as great a person as she was a [SKILL], and her next company will be lucky to have him/her.

3. Hi [NAME], thanks for the recommendation! I’m glad I was a good [something the person said about you].
You were also a great colleague and very [make a compliment]. Let me know if you would like me to leave you a recommendation as well. I’ll gladly do it.
Kind regards,
[your name]

## Summary
So now we know about the recommendations section inn LinkedIn, let's summarize the above in 2 min. Take it as personal, always write a positive message. Don’t say things you don’t believe in otherwise your recommendation will sound fake. Be professional this is not a chance to complain or give feedback. Keep it as short as possible, although, you have up to 3000 characters, but there is no need to use them all. Don’t be repetitive and try to add up to 3 paragraphs. You must finish the recommendation with a powerful statement.

In the next chapter, we will start with posting content on LinkedIn.
