# Chapter - 2 Networking
So, now you have made your profile on LinkedIn that contains a lot of information about you. It's time to tell people that who are you, make connections with them. So, what is networking? The answer is simple the word networking means connecting with people and LinkedIn enables you to network with people and professional organizations in your industry. This is a great way to stay up to date with the latest developments, and to share information with others in your field. 

## How do we network?
Hopefully, you avoided reaching out to new contacts and accepting connection requests until your profile was in tip-top shape. You need to assume that people will check out your profile when you are connecting. And with many connections, that’s your first impression as **You never get a second chance to make a first impression**\
 When it comes to networking in LinkedIn, there are two primary functions – just like in real-world networking: Building your network and nurturing relationships. I’ll cover both in this chapter.

 ### Build Your Network 
 Before we go further, I want to explain an important part of LinkedIn that will impact your thoughts on networking. Many people I speak to only want to connect with people they know. That strategy appears to play it safe, but it will work against you because of how LinkedIn is programmed. If you want to show up frequently in searches and you want to see the maximum number of full profiles, you need to be promiscuous in your connections strategy.\
   Don't worry, if you’re still feeling a little queasy about being an open networker by accepting most connection requests. It should allay your fears to know that LinkedIn makes it really easy to remove, block, or report a connection. So any connection request you accept can be disconnected.

With that in mind, it’s time to build your network. There are four primary ways to do it:

**1. Reach out**: When you’re reaching out, remember to customize the request instead of using the unimaginative “I would like to add you to my network.” You can even customize requests as follows:

• While you’re at your invitee’s profile, click on the three dots in the upper right (don’t use the connect button).

• Choose “Personalize Invite.”

• Write a custom message, and then click send as shown below.

**2. Accept connection requests**: Know your criteria for accepting requests (and remember what you lose if you are a closed networker). LinkedIn alerts you when you have requests. Get in the habit of accepting them soon after receiving them.

**3. Connect to people who are suggested by LinkedIn**: LinkedIn has an algorithm that helps identify “people you may know,” who might be valuable to add to your network. Review the suggestions regularly and connect as appropriate. Your network will grow significantly over time. 

**4. Use groupsPreview**: Groups are the most powerful networking feature in LinkedIn . Why? Because they give you access to huge numbers of people who are all interested in the same topics you are. And LinkedIn allows you to join up to 100 groups. Research a variety of groups and join the ones that are populated by your target audience members. You can join groups related to your area of thought-leadership, social causes, alumni, etc. Look for groups that have lots of members and lots of activity.

Once you join a group you must do the following actions:
1. Spend a little time getting to know how the group works, who’s most vocal, what content gets the most buzz, etc.

2. You can introduce yourself. Let other members know you are new to the group and share a little bit about why you are there.   

### Nurture Your Network
By the word nurture I mean taking care of your relationship with connections. Adding people to your network won’t help you build a relationship with them. You need to engage with them regularly. Here’s how:

**1. Interact**: 
 1. Provide status updates on a regular basis. It keeps you visible to the people in your brand community.

 2. Like and comment on LinkedIn posts that you think are valuable, and share the posts with your connections and other groups you belong to.
 3.  Share content you find at other sites that you think would be valuable. When sharing, remember to add content saying why you think it is valuable and expressing your point of view.

**2. Acknowledge**: LinkedIn does the heavy lifting when it comes to staying on top of people in your network. They provide notifications when someone you know has a birthday, work anniversary, or new job. You have the option of “liking” the notification or sending a message. I suggest choosing “send a message” and writing a personal note. Determine a time of day you will check in and get in the habit of doing it daily so you don’t miss any of your connections’ important dates.

**3. Engage, engage, engage**: Take a few minutes per day to thoughtfully comment on other people's posts, articles and videos. After you do this on a few posts, send the person a connection request. They'll be much more likely to connect with you if you're a familiar face.

## Tips For Networking
It's well known that networking is the key to a successful career. You can have the skills and the education, but without connections, it will be very difficult to get a job or even build a business. A recent study by Right Management found that for the fifth year in a row, person-to-person networking is the most effective way of finding a new job. Networking had a 46 percent effectiveness rate, compared to Internet job boards (25 percent), recruiters (14 percent), the direct approach (7 percent) and newspaper listings (1 percent).

A lot of people have trouble with networking because they are introverted, feel like they are using people and come off as selfish instead of helpful. Here are five tips that will help you, even if you're not a natural chatterer:

### 1. Connect with people you know on LinkedIn 

My number one piece of advice for networking on LinkedIn is to make sure you’re connected with people you know, including friends, family and colleagues. These are the people who likely know you best, can speak to your work ethic and who you are as an individual. Check out the “People You May Know” feature on the “My Network” tab on LinkedIn as an easy way to find and connect with people who went to the same school as you, who work in similar roles or industries and based in the same city. 

### 2. Reconnect with contacts you’ve lost touch with

Reaching out to people you may not have spoken to in a while can feel uncomfortable, but there are easy ways to break the ice. Consider reaching out via a message on LinkedIn acknowledging the time gap with an introduction like: “It’s been a while since we last spoke, I hope you’re staying well in light of the current circumstances.” You can also engage with their content on LinkedIn by “liking” or commenting on their posts to show your support.

Maintaining relationships is a critical component of networking, so it’s a good idea to make time to stay in touch with your close contacts. For example, put a reminder on your calendar every six weeks to check in and ask what they’re working on. Send an email on birthdays or to congratulate a recent achievement. Making a habit of consistent communication in a genuine way will be beneficial in the long run.

### 3. Share your insights and stories by posting

A great way to network on LinkedIn is by sharing your experiences and ideas, and you can do this in a few different ways. Consider re-sharing a connection’s LinkedIn’s post with one or two of your key takeaways. A manager and need virtual team-building ideas? Share a few learnings based on your experience, and ask your network for their tips which can kick-start a conversation in the comments section of your post. If you’re on the creative side, host a short video interview with a colleague on your company’s LinkedIn Page. Need a quick gut check? Run a Poll to get insights and perspectives from your network and use responses to start up a conversation. 

Try to post on a regular basis and include relevant hashtags on your content which will extend reach beyond your first-degree connections. If you’re job seeking, this could prompt hiring managers or other professionals to reach out to you directly. For more tips to share your insights on LinkedIn, read on here.

### 4. Create Win/Win Situations
It's very important that both you and the other party gain equally when networking. If you benefit more than the other person, he or she will feel cheated and used. When that happens, you won't be able to go back and built a long-term relationship.
### 5. Become A Connector

You don't always have to gain something in a networking relationship. If you can introduce people who can benefit from one another, it's just as effective. You can build a stronger rapport with multiple people and it makes you very good.

### 6. LinkedIn Open Networker (LION)
The LinkedIn Open Networker is a member of the professional social networking site that encourages connections from any member of the site by publicly declaring they are open networkers. In other words, they are open to connecting with anyone who sends an invitation to them.

Under most circumstances, when you sign up for a LinkedIn account, you are placed into a network—according to your location and possibly your school and professional affiliations. This creates limits on the number of people who can become your connection.

But by becoming a LinkedIn Open Networker, you open the possibility of expanding your connection base by quickly increasing the number of people in your network.

 **How to join**: To join a LION group within LinkedIn by searching “Lion” or “open networkers” under the Groups option in the site’s search engine. You will a lot of groups, just enter in anyone which has a good number of members.

Remember, once you proclaim yourself as an open networker, you’re opening yourself up to hundreds (or potentially thousands) of networking opportunities. This could be good or bad, of course. So it’s up to you to decide if increasing your networking opportunities in this way will be effective for your job search.
