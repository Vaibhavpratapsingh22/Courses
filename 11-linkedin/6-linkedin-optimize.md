p# Chapter - 6 How to Optimize Your Profile for Better Search Visibility

Having a great LinkedIn profile helps you attract recruiters' attention when they're looking for new talent to join their company's teams. Don't forget that 90% of recruiters use LinkedIn on a regular basis! 

However, LinkedIn is not only for job seekers. It's a great way to position yourself as an expert in your industry or even as an influencer! More and more professionals use LinkedIn on a regular basis for both professional and personal development. The best way to get a good rank in the search bar is by using the keywords. Lets understand what are they, how to use them efficiently.  

## Keywords
Keywords are ideas and topics that define what your content is about. In terms of SEO, they're the words and phrases that searchers enter into search engines, also called "search queries." If you boil everything on your page — all the images, video, copy, etc. — down to simple words and phrases, those are your primary keywords.

As a website owner and content creator, you want the keywords on your page to be relevant to what people are searching for so they have a better chance of finding your content among the results.

### Why are keywords important?
Keywords are important because they are the linchpin between what people are searching for and the content you are providing to fill that need.

 Your goal in ranking on search engines is to drive organic traffic to your site from the search engine result pages (SERPs), and the keywords you choose to target (meaning, among other things, the ones you choose to include in your content) will determine what kind of traffic you get. If you own a golf shop, for example, you might want to rank for "new clubs" — but if you're not careful, you might end up attracting traffic that's interested in finding a new place to dance after dark.

 ### Places to add keywords

 1. **Add keywords to your job title**: The Job Title field on LinkedIn is also a highly indexed field (as is your Employer name). So put the best keywords that you have listened from people, or you have seen in some good profiles.

 2. **Use your about section**: The word limit for the summary is 2000 word and that's a huge space. You can plenty of keywords there, but remember that don't just add all the keywords. Make it look like professional.
