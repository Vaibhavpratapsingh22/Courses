# Chapter - 6 How to Optimize Your Profile for Better Search Visibility

Having a great LinkedIn profile helps you attract recruiters' attention when they're looking for new talent to join their company's teams. Don't forget that 90% of recruiters use LinkedIn on a regular basis! 

However, LinkedIn is not only for job seekers. It's a great way to position yourself as an expert in your industry or even as an influencer! More and more professionals use LinkedIn on a regular basis for both professional and personal development. The best way to get a good rank in the search bar is by using the keywords. Lets understand what are they, how to use them efficiently.  

## Keywords
Keywords are ideas and topics that define what your profile is about. In terms of SEO, they're the words and phrases that searchers enter into search engines, also called "search queries." If you boil everything on your profile that are all the images, video, copy, etc. Down to simple words and phrases, those are your primary keywords.

But to have a good LinkedIn profile, you want the keywords on your profile to be relevant to what people are searching for so they have a better chance of finding your profile among the results.

### Why are keywords important?
Keywords are important because they are the linchpin between what people are searching for and your profile to fill that need.

 Your goal is to rank good on search engines is to drive traffic to your profile from the search engine result and the keywords you choose to target will determine what kind of traffic you get. If you are a web developer, for example, you might want to rank for website building companies but if you're not careful, you might end up attracting traffic that's interested in finding a new place to dance after dark. So it is very important to add keywords to your profile, but where?

 ### Places to add keywords
You should add keywords in every section of your profile, below I have mentioned some fixed places where keywords are must to add:
 1. **Add keywords to your job title**: The Job Title field on LinkedIn is also a highly indexed field (as is your Employer name). So put the best keywords that you have listened from people, or you have seen in some good profiles.

 2. **Use your about section**: The word limit for the summary is 2000 word and that's a huge space. You can plenty of keywords there, but remember that don't just add all the keywords. Make it look like professional.
