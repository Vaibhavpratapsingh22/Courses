# Chapter 7 - Coaching

Coaching has traditionally been associated with sports. Every top athlete has a coach. In the last few years, coaching has become applicable in every area, in business, and every aspect of life as well as sport. Now, it is quite normal for someone to see a coach to help them achieve their goals in their life and work. Coaching has been defined in many different ways but the essence of coaching is:

- To help a person change in the way they wish and helping them go in the direction they want to go
- Coaching supports a person at every level in becoming who they want to be
- It builds awareness empowers choice and leads to change

In short, the responsibility of a coach is not to tell the solution to the coachee but instead to guide them to discover the solution themselves. For this, The coach need not be an expert in their coachee's field of work.\
I have found it easier to explain to people what coaching is by explaining what coaching is not. To make the picture more clear let us see some common misinterpretations about coaching.

1. **Consulting:** A consultant provides expertise and solves business problems, or develops business as a whole.
2. **Mentoring:** is when a senior colleague, seen as more knowledgeable and worldly-wise gives advice and provides a role model.
3. **Teaching:** is passing on information or skill to help others learn new things.
4. **Training:** is the process of getting knowledge skills or abilities by study, experience, or teaching.
5. **Counseling:** is to give professional help and advice to (someone) to resolve personal or professional problems.
6. **Therapy:** is working with the client who seeks relief from psychological or physical symptoms.

Now as we have already seen what is coaching, let's see what and Who a Scrum Master coaches.

## Scrum Master as a Coach

The Scrum Master supports and enables the dev team, the PO, and the organization through coaching to deliver the highest value to the customers, improve the ROI and develop adaptability within the organization.

To describe the Scrum Master as a coach, three different perspectives can be used. The individual, the team, and the organization. To coach the individual with a focus on mindset and behavior, to continuously improve the team, and to help the organization in real collaboration with the Scrum teams.\
A great coach does not compartmentalize timings for organization coaching, team coaching, and individual coaching. A great coach makes him/herself available at any point in time for anyone. From my experience, a great coaching session happens at the least expected time. Coaching both the team and the individual at any point of time happens throughout the Sprint. Even in the middle of the Sprint, the Scrum Master is coaching the team to work effectively. For example, in the middle of the Sprint, the team may need to refine the Product Backlog or maybe doing mob-programming to solve complex problems. During these activities, the Scrum Master may pepper coaching aspects to improve the way teams collaborate.

### Coach the Development Team

The Scrum Master may spend significant time and effort coaching the development team. More so where serving a team new to Scrum. The Scrum Master coaches the development team to accomplish these four outcomes:

- Self-Organization
- Cross-Functionality
- Foresee and Remove Impediments
- Improve Collaboration

### Coach the Product Owner

The Scrum Master coaches the Product Owner to internalize the concept of agility and what being adaptable means and he holds the PO accountable to identify market changes and adjusting direction to minimize risk and maximize ROI. The Scrum Master coaches the PO in the following areas:

- To improve Product Backlog Management efficacy
- To understand the empirical way of Product Planning
- To order the PB to maximize business value
- To understand and practice agility

### Coach the Organization

The Scrum Master coaches the people in the organization to develop a learning organization that is flexible and adaptable to market changes. Some of the major challenges and opportunities while coaching the organization are:

- Help the organization achieve amazing results by delivering high quality, high-quality products
- Coach the entire organization in product management with a focus on delivering ongoing business value
- Support and promote the collaboration of the Scrum teams

Coaching empowers and brings out the best in them. SM as a coach helps in unleashing a person’s or a team’s latent potential. This helps to maximize performance with the same amount of effort. It's about empowering people to learn to solve their problems rather than teaching them or solving problems for them. The SM as a coach helps the Scrum Team as well as the organization, adopt Scrum and enhance team and enterprise agility. Let's have a look at some models which you can use.

### Coaching Models

There are several coaching models you as SM can refer to. We as a coach should know all the available coaching models. We need to know which one to use when.\
**1. GROW MODEL:** is a coaching framework used in conversations, meetings and everyday leadership to unlock potential and possibilities. To read more on this model click [here](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_89.htm).

**2. OSKAR MODEL:** Originating from the Solutions Focused Approach the OSKAR coaching model is a powerful framework to help your coaching sessions focus on solutions rather than problems.

**4. SPACE MODEL:** is used in the cognitive-behavioral approaches to coaching. If you want to get more information on this particular model click [here](https://coachcampus.com/coach-portfolios/coaching-models/iani-bacula-space/).\
**5. POSITIVE MODEL:** This is a model developed from the GROW and ACHIEVE models. To know more click [here](https://www.toolshero.com/management/positive-model-of-coaching/).\
**6. SBI MODEL:** CCL’s widely-recognized model for delivering feedback, the Situation-Behavior-Impact Model (SBI), is proven to reduce the anxiety of delivering feedback and also reduce the defensiveness of the recipient. To read more about this model click [here](https://www.ccl.org/articles/leading-effectively-articles/closing-the-gap-between-intent-and-impact/).\
**7. 5D MODEL:** It can be especially useful if the team has found a problem that they want to solve either in an ad hoc discussion or in a separate retrospective meeting. It consists of five phases: Define, Discover, Dream, Design and Deliver. You can run this as a guided discussion, or you can plan exercises to draw out the best ideas.

### Skills for Scrum Master to be a Coach

Now Let's look at the skills that make a Scrum Master an outstanding Scrum coach. SM can use these skills to check if (s)he is doing coaching in a way the chances of success will be the highest.

**1. Active Listening:** The success of all coaching conversations depends on the ability of the coach to listen deeply. It requires practice to listen to what people say. But to be able to listen to what is, it takes a whole lot of letting go. Such as shedding the internal biases, personal agenda, the need for winning, and silencing the inner self. This level of listening requires being in the moment. To explain it further, let's see the _"Active Listening Model"_.

<p align="center"> <img width="" height="500" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QidCLZ25R3i8kqpTO77w"></p>

This Image explains what kind of listening happens at different levels. Acing the three levels of listening is a vital condition for each coach. The most effective coaching takes place when the coach is at Level 2 and 3. There will be times when coaches will drop into their Level 1 place. As a coach, the key is to notice when you are listening at Level 1 and find your way back “over there” with the client. Sometimes all it takes is asking a provocative, curious question. To read more on this model click [here](https://coachfederation.org/blog/the-art-of-listening). That brings us to next skill.

**2. Powerful Questioning:** The SM uses powerful questions to fuel coaching conversations. SM learns and practices this art of asking questions. What makes a powerful question?\
A powerful question is unbiased, clarifying, open-ended, inviting, challenging, solution-focused and empowering. By moving away from telling, answering, and solving, the coach takes a stance of asking powerful questions.\
Being a great coach is NOT about giving the best advice, it's about asking the right questions. Asking Powerful questions Interrupts coachee's though pattern and forces them to shift from Telling to Thinking. Types of Powerful Questions: <p align="center"> <img width="500" height="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1880/1*8GnR645lylbn1hN7kJ4lOg.png"></p>

**3. Art of Powerful Questions:** There is a great quote by Albert Einstein - “If I had an hour to solve a problem and my life depended on the solution, I would spend the first 55 minutes determining the proper question to ask, for once I know the proper question, I could solve the problem in less than five minutes.”\
Asking the powerful question is an art that has to be practiced, you cannot make a list of questions and use the same questions every time, but what you can do is listen so closely to your coachee in terms of what they are saying, even reflecting back to them. Doing this will interrupt their thought pattern and it will make them think clearly towards what they want to achieve, this is what asking the right yet powerful questions can do.
