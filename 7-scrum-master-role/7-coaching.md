# Chapter 7 - Coaching

Coaching has traditionally been associated with sports. Every top athlete has a coach. In the last few years, coaching has become applicable in every area, in business, and every aspect of life as well as sport. Now, it is quite normal for someone to see a coach to help them achieve their goals in their life and work. Coaching has been defined in many different ways but the essence of coaching is:

- To help a person change in the way they wish and helping them go in the direction they want to go.
- Coaching supports a person at every level in becoming who they want to be.
- It builds awareness empowers choice and leads to change.

In short, the responsibility of a coach is not to tell the solution to the coachee but instead to guide them to discover the solution themselves. The coach need not be an expert in their coachee's field of work.

I have found it easier to explain to people what coaching is by explaining what coaching is not. To make the picture more clear let us see some common misinterpretations about coaching.

1. _Consulting_ - A consultant provides expertise and solves business problems, or develops a business as a whole.
2. _Mentoring_ - is when a senior colleague, seen as more knowledgeable and worldly-wise gives advice and provides a role model.
3. _Teaching_ - is passing on information or skill to help others learn new things.
4. _Training_ - is the process of getting knowledge skills or abilities by study, experience, or teaching.
5. _Counseling_ - is to give professional help and advice to (someone) to resolve personal or professional problems.
6. _Therapy_ - is working with the client who seeks relief from psychological or physical symptoms.

Now as we have already seen what is coaching, you might be wondering who does the SM coaches.

## Scrum Master Coaches

To describe the Scrum Master as a coach, three different perspectives can be used. The individual, the team, and the organization. To coach the individual with a focus on mindset and behavior, to continuously improve the team, and to help the organization in real collaboration with the Scrum teams.

### Coach the Individual

- Explain the desired way of thinking and behavior, help individuals see new perspectives and possibilities
- Influence individual team members to use Scrum properly
- Help each person take the next step on their agile journey

### Coach the Team

- Stimulate a mindset of continuous improvement, create a learning culture
- Support the team in solving problems and resolving conflicts
- Coach the team to reach the point where members learn best to learn from one another
- Change attitudes, mindsets, and behavior that prevent the team from doing Scrum properly
- Coach the team to give each other open and honest feedback

### Coach the Organization

- Help the organization achieve amazing results by delivering high quality, high-quality products
- Coach the entire organization in product management with a focus on delivering ongoing business value
- Support and promote the collaboration of the Scrum teams

Coaching empowers and brings out the best in them. SM as a coach helps in unleashing a person’s or a team’s latent potential. This helps to maximize performance with the same amount of effort. It's about empowering people to learn to solve their problems rather than teaching them or solving problems for them. The SM as a coach helps the Scrum Team as well as the organization, adopt Scrum and enhance team and enterprise agility. There are many structures you can use for coaching, one of the structure I commonly use is the GROW model.

Now Let's look at the skills that make a Scrum Master an outstanding Scrum coach. SM can use these skills to check if (s)he is doing coaching in a way the chances of success will be the highest.

### Skills for Scrum Master to be a Coach

<p align="center"> <img width="600" height="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63605352/91661313-94003380-eadb-11ea-8c95-04370d5179bd.JPG"></p>

**1. Establishing a Trust-based Relation:** A trust-based relation allows the coachee to be vulnerable, feel safe to discover their potential, and transform to get better. SM achieves this is by creating an environment of radical transparency. Transparency of information improves trust.\
**2. Active Listening:** The success of all coaching conversations depends on the ability of the coach to listen deeply. It requires practice to listen to what people say. But to be able to listen to what is, it takes a whole lot of letting go. Such as shedding the internal biases, personal agenda, the need for winning, and silencing the inner self. This level of listening requires being in the moment. To explain it further, let's see the _"Active Listening Model"_.

<p align="center"> <img width="" height="500" src="https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/QidCLZ25R3i8kqpTO77w"></p>

This Image explains what kind of listening happens at different levels. Acing the three levels of listening is a vital condition for each coach. The most effective coaching takes place when the coach is at Level 2 and 3. There will be times when coaches will drop into their own Level 1 place. As a coach, the key is to notice when you are listening at Level 1 and find your way back “over there” with the client. Sometimes all it takes is asking a provocative, curious question. That brings us to next skill.\
**3. Powerful Questioning:** The SM uses powerful questions to fuel coaching conversations. SM learns and practices this art of asking questions. What makes a powerful question?\
A powerful question is unbiased, clarifying, open-ended, inviting, challenging, solution-focused and empowering. By moving away from telling, answering, and solving, the coach takes a stance of asking powerful questions.\
Being a great coach is NOT about giving the best advice, it's about asking the right questions. Asking Powerful questions Interrupts coachee's though pattern and forces them to shift from Telling to Thinking. Types of Powerful Questions: <p align="center"> <img width="500" height="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1880/1*8GnR645lylbn1hN7kJ4lOg.png"></p>
**4. Leading by Example:** To be able to earn trust and influence others, the SM must exhibit behaviors that she so desires from her coachees. A good coach has a learning attitude, welcomes feedback, continuously works on improving herself, is flexible, and is comfortable to experiment and fail.\
**5. Focusing on the Present:** What helps people move forward and make progress is living and acting in the present. A good coach lives in the present and helps the coachee make the best of the opportunity at hand, accept the present and adapt to the situation at hand by taking action in the now.\
**6. Acknowledging the coachee as Whole and Resourceful:** This comes from Co-Active Coaching approach that emphasizes that – People are inherently whole and resourceful. They don’t to be fixed. If the SM accepts this she will be able to allow the coachee the freedom and empowerment to find their solutions.\
**7. Being a Servant-leader:** The Scrum Master as a Servant Leader operates from the stance of serving others. Serving the Scrum Team is an essential responsibility of a SM. The objective is to be able to serve the team, empower, them and help them build the capability to deliver the best they possibly can.\
Coaching is the best intervention to accomplish deeper and sustainable change in the way people think and behave. The Scrum Master is responsible to help the team grow to be a cross-functional and self-organizing team and derive maximum benefits of adopting Scrum. Moving from traditional functional silos and top-down driven teams to cross-functional and self-organizing teams requires a major shift in the behaviors of people, in the organizational structure as well as culture.
