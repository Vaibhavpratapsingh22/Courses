# Chapter 6 - Teaching

A teacher is someone who passes on information or skill to help others learn new things.\
In our education years, we meet different teachers some leave a permanent mark on our story and some are forgotten, do you remember the educator laughing at students' mistakes on not being able to admit his errors or maybe the one holding on to his tank boost so much that he answers every tough question from a student with a definition mantra.\
Or on the other side do you remember a truly caring teacher who was interested in your growth. A professional passionate about their subject, seeing learning and teaching as a journey with many steps but no final destination. The one who doesn't hold the answer but curiosity willing to find them out together with students, a teacher who is maybe even sometimes tricked but honest.

## Scrum Master as a Teacher

Scrum master as we all know is a servant leader for Scrum Team. So they are deeply interested in the growth development of the team. The Scrum framework is a tool for opportunistic discovery which means that it's a tool that helps the team to effectively create a product and improve the team itself. So a good SM truly cares if a team understands and knows how to use scrum. SM teaches them how to deliver value.\
SM educates which boundaries framed the empirical process, what tools and practices can be used, or are harmful depending on the context like a great sports coach. They skillfully foster the understanding that the great team is much more than the sum of its members. SM teaches how to experiment and reflect on the results. They are not involved directly in the tactics he/she leaves the room for self-organization, but they are always near to support and help by holding a mirror for the team to see the naked facts.

### Scrum Master Teaches

When it comes to teaching, the primary focus for the SM is the Development team and Product Owner. But the SM should also ensure Scrum is understood by everyone else involved with the Scrum team. SM Teaches them:

#### Team

**1. Agile:** First thing SM should do is to take the team back to the core of Agile and Scrum within the first week of a new squad. Explaining the Agile manifesto and emphasize that in reality, the customer discovers what he wants, the developers discover how to build it and things will change along the way. Although some team members might have quite a lot of agile experience, it's about getting all on the same page.\
**2. The core of Scrum:** Using Scrum can be compared with playing chess. You either play it as its rules state, or you don't. Scrum and chess don't fail or succeed. They are either played, or not. Some teams start using Scrum leaving out some of the parts of the framework. Teach them the framework in detail with stating why is it important to use it the way it is. If you want to refer to the ([Scrum Framework](https://github.com/Vaibhavpratapsingh22/Courses/blob/master/7-scrum-master-role/1-scrum.md)).\
**3. The differences between Scrum and good practices:** Nowadays, a lot of good practices have become strongly intertwined with the core of Scrum. Teaching the team the differences is useful. Examples of good practices are using story points, doing the daily Scrum, or using a burndown chart for tracking visual progress. All of these are good practices, but they are not mandatory considering the core of Scrum.\
**4. Teach them about Self-organization:** A self-organizing team is a group of motivated individuals, who work together toward a goal, have the ability and authority to take decisions and readily adapt to changing demands. A Scrum Master, as the promoter of Scrum and self-organization, should consider how to help a team work out their problems themselves and offer any tools, training and insights on how to best do this.\
**5. Creating a shared identity:** The team should be aware of the prerequisites of teamwork. What does is take to be a team? What does it mean to be a team? For this refer to the chapter ([Team Building](https://github.com/Vaibhavpratapsingh22/Courses/blob/master/7-scrum-master-role/4-team-building.md)).\
**T6. each the about Impediments:** In Scrum, an impediment is anything that keeps the team from being productive. It's the job of SM to ensure impediments are being removed. The SM only removes impediments that exceed the self-organizing capabilities of the Development Team. Otherwise, it's not an impediment, just a problem the team needs to fix by themselves.\
**7. Visualizing Progress as a Team:** Team should keep Transparency and visualize product - and sprint backlog, which is a good practice. Other practices for visualizing progress or improve collaboration are burn-down charts, setting up a board with impediments and improvements, showing the availability of the team members or creating a sprint calendar that shows all the events and meetings.

#### Product Owner

**1. Backlog management:** The SM should teach the Product Owner how to create a product backlog, how to order it based on priority, value, risk and dependencies and how to involve the entire team with managing the backlog.\
**2. The importance of the Product Vision:** This is also the part where the Product Owner comes along. Probably the team was created with a purpose, e.g. to build a new product. It's crucial the team knows and understands the vision the Product Owner has with his/her product. The team can only make the right decisions if they understand the purpose of the product. A clear vision basically acts as a lighthouse for the Development team, necessary in difficult times.

#### Organization

**1. Scrum:** The Scrum framework can be quite disruptive for some organizations. It causes the change that some people might find difficult to cope with. Explaining the purpose of Scrum and the need for some changes is important to create mutual understanding and build a foundation that ensures the changes truly stick.

These are some examples of what a SM could teach the Dev Team, PO, and organization. For sure this list isn't entirely complete, but The most important lesson I've learned is don't try to teach the team everything upfront, allow them to fail, and learn from there own mistakes. There are different Teaching Frameworks that SM can use to teach them. Let's see the framework now.

## Teaching Frameworks

Now, we are going to talk about a framework/model which is unique and quite in demand these days, the name of the model is The 4Cs Model. Here we will see the model and also a template with an example.

### The 4Cs

4Cs also known as Training from the BACK of the Room was developed by Sharon Bowman in the USA and offers a pragmatic way to design and conduct your own training/teaching courses so that all participants can learn as effectively as possible. Sharon Bowman has combined her own decades of educational experience as a teacher and trainer with a continuous extraction of research literature on neurosciences. The result is the structure of the 4 Cs:

1. Connect (C1 - connections)
2. Concepts (C2 - Concepts)
3. Concrete Practice (C3 - Concrete Practice)
4. Conclusions (C4 - draw conclusions)

**1. C1 - Connections:** Learners will actively make connections with:

- Knowledge - what they already know about the topic
- Learning Objective – What they will learn
- Personal Goals – What they want to learn
- Community Building – Learn with each other

There are many ways to start with activities like warm-ups, fast pass or start-ups. At the beginning this point is the focus, later this aspect is included in the prepared activities.\
**2. C2 - Concepts:** They absorb new information and process it: hearing, seeing, discussing, noting, reflecting, mind games and, above all, participating in short, quick repetition exercises.

- Instructor delivers contents with brief lecture segments (10-20 minutes in length)
- The instructor leads 1-3 minutes review activities between each lecture segment

The participants must develop and apply the knowledge themselves. They should transform themselves from pure consumers into active learners. Concept maps, interactive lectures, or jigsaw activities can be used. The trainer only tells and explains the bare essentials. The participants can experience and try.\
**3. C3 - Concrete practice:** A training which enables the participants to acquire the knowledge themselves, be it in collaboration with others, are regarded as good training. Learner can:

- Practice a skill or a task using training content
- Participate in extended active review of what is learned

The Instructor observes and provides positive and corrective feedback. It is important to repeatedly encourage the participants to actively contribute themselves. The trainer is not a motivational speaker when the mind wanders. Possible exercises are teach-backs, skill-based activities, or learner-created games. This part of the training is the largest part.\
**4. C4 - Draw Conclusions**
Good training does not end with embarrassed silence after the question "Are there any questions?" You end with motivated participants who methodically determine and evaluate what they have experienced in the training as well as create their own meaningful summaries and develop plans for the time after the seminar. Learners should:

- Summarize and evaluate what is learned
- Create action plan on how to use new knowledge and skills

As an Instructor, you lead the conclusion and celebration activities. The participants work out follow-up activities during the training and thus take the spirit and content of the training with them. It is important that the learning success is made transparent and that it is truly experienced and celebrated by the participants.

Here is a Sample Training Map which you can use as a reference for your team,

I have also attached the PDF of the book, where you can find more information about this framework.\

## Summary

For SM as a teacher, they need to be clear about what it is learners need to know to be able to demonstrate their learning of it. This seems simple enough. The knowledge it takes to do something is inseparable from the doing. The challenge for us arises in separating need - to - know from nice - to - know information, and not becoming sidetracked teaching content that has little to do with the learning. To help them with this situation the framework which we just saw will come in handy and they should try adjusting it as per the needs of the team.
