# Chapter 1 - Scrum

Scrum is a framework within which people can address complex adaptive problems, while productively and creatively delivering products of the highest possible value.\
Scrum, a popular agile framework originally used for software development, is now being successfully implemented in other business domains. In a unique twist, agile is now being applied to personal project management. Though some agile techniques may not apply, the concepts of iterative processes, continuous improvement, empowerment, and collaboration can be applied to many areas of personal life.\
Scrum is now also used for Event Planning, one of the most creative I've seen is Scrum Your Wedding, a wedding planning business that educates customers on how to plan a wedding using scrum.

## Scrum Framework

People often think Scrum and agile are the same thing because Scrum is centered around continuous improvement, which is a core principle of agile. However, Scrum is a framework for getting work done, where agile is a mindset. You can’t really “go agile”, as it takes dedication from the whole team to change the way they think about delivering value to your customers. But you can use a framework like Scrum to help you start thinking that way and to practice building agile principles into your everyday communication and work.

Scrum implements the scientific method of empiricism. Scrum replaces a programmed algorithmic approach with a heuristic one, with respect for people and self-organization to deal with unpredictability and solving complex problems. Scrum is structured to help teams naturally adapt to changing conditions and user requirements, with re-prioritization built into the process and short release cycles so your team can constantly learn and improve. It acknowledges that the team doesn’t know everything at the start of a project and will evolve through experience.

### Scrum Principles

Scrum is founded on empirical process control theory, or empiricism. Empiricism asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is known. Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimize predictability and control risk. Three pillars uphold every implementation of empirical process control:

1. **Transparency**: To make decisions, people need visibility into the process and the current state of the product. To ensure everyone understands what they are seeing, participants in an empirical process must share one language.
2. **Inspection**: To prevent deviation from the desired process or end product, people need to inspect what is being created, and how, at regular intervals. Inspection should occur at the point of work but should not get in the way of that work.
3. **Adaptation**: When deviations occur, the process or product should be adjusted as soon as possible.

**Scrum is Iterative & Incremental**

1. **Iterative**: A process for arriving at a decision or a desired result by repeating rounds of analysis or a cycle of operations. The objective is to bring the desired decision or result closer to discovery with each repetition (iteration) Scrum’s use of a repeating cycle of iterations is iterative.
2. **Incremental**: A series of small improvements to an existing product or product line that usually helps maintain or improve its competitive position over time. Incremental innovation is regularly used within the high technology business by companies that need to continue to improve their products to include new features increasingly desired by consumers. The way Scrum teams deliver pieces of functionality into small batches is incremental.

### Scrum Values

Successful use of Scrum depends on people becoming more proficient in living these five values:

1. **Courage**: The Scrum Team members have courage to do the right thing and work on tough problems. The value of courage is critical to a team’s success. Team mebers must feel safe enough to say no, to ask for help, and to try new things. Teams must be brave enough to question the status quo when it hampers their ability to succeed.
2. **Focus**: Everyone focuses on the work of the Sprint and the goals of the Scrum Team. The value of focus is one of the best skills Scrum teams can develop. Focus means that whatever Scrum teams start they finish so, teams are relentless about limiting the amount of work in process (limit WIP).
3. **Commitment**: People personally commit to achieving the goals of the Scrum Team. Scrum teams only agree to take on tasks they believe they can complete, so they are careful not to overcommit. Scrum teams work together as a unit. This means that they trust each other to follow through on what they say they are going to do.

4. **Respect**: Scrum team members demonstrate respect to one another, to the Product Owner, to Stakeholders, and to the ScrumMaster to be capable, independent people. They know that their strength lies in how well they collaborate, and that everyone has a distinct contribution to make toward completing the work of the sprint. They respect each other’s ideas, give each other permission to have a bad day once in a while, and recognize each other’s accomplishments.
5. **Openness**: The Scrum Team and its stakeholders agree to be open about all the work and the challenges with performing the work. Scrum teams consistently seek out new ideas and opportunities to learn.

## Scrum Team

The Scrum Team consists of a Product Owner, the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional. Self-organizing teams choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team. Cross-functional teams have all competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team. The team model in Scrum is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity. The Scrum Team has proven itself to be increasingly effective for all the earlier stated uses, and any complex work.\
Scrum Teams deliver products iteratively and incrementally, maximizing opportunities for feedback. Incremental deliveries of “Done” product ensure a potentially useful version of working product is always available.

1. **Product Owner**: The PO defines the what--as in what the product will look like and what features it should contain. The PO is expected to incorporate stakeholder feedback to create the highest value product increments each and every sprint. POs maintain the product backlog and ensures that everyone knows the priorities.
2. **Development Team**: The Development Team decides how to accomplish the work set forth by the PO. Development Teams are structured and empowered to organize and manage their own work. The resulting synergy optimizes overall efficiency and effectiveness.
3. **Scrum Master**: The ScrumMaster helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. ScrumMasters hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself.

**Scrum Team Working Agreements**: The purpose of the working agreement is to ensure the Team shares responsibility in defining expectations for how they will function together and enhance their self-organization process. It creates an awareness of both positive (and negative) behaviors that can impact the Team and empowers the Scrum Master to keep them accountable.\
The process of defining the Team’s working agreement is straightforward. The Scrum Master facilitates a session with the Development Team and Product Owner, where they generate several team disciplines together. A working agreement should be recalled easily, so they will then vote on the top five to ten disciplines. Once the Team has agreed upon a set of disciplines, they should be posted in their designated area and/or stored in a virtual folder that is accessible to all members.

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum artifacts are ways to describe the work that must be done, and they always add value during a sprint. Scrum artifacts can be seen as nuggets of vital information for the scrum team. They capture shared information for the team at a particular point in time.

This is vitally important, especially for distributed teams who may work from home because it provides a platform where they can see how they’re doing on a particular sprint. This keeps everyone on the same page, no matter where they are.

Scrum defines three artifacts: Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, and a product increment.

1. **Product Backlog**: The PB is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in a product. It is constantly evolving and is never complete.

2. **Sprint Backlog**: The Sprint Backlog is a list of everything that the team commits to achieve in a given Sprint. Once created, no one can add to the Sprint Backlog except the Development Team.

   If the Development Team needs to drop an item from the Sprint Backlog, they must negotiate it with the PO. During this negotiation, the ScrumMaster should work with the Development Team and PO to try to find ways to create some smaller increment of an item rather than drop it altogether.

3. **Product Increment**: At the end of every Sprint, the team must complete a product increment that is potentially releasable, meaning that meets their agreed-upon definition of done. (An example might be fully tested and fully approved.)

**Artifacts Transparency**

1. **Definition of Done**: DoD in Scrum refers to the bindingly agreed acceptance criteria for the implementation of a backlog item or an increment. Each Scrum Team has its own DoD or consistent acceptance criteria across all User Stories. A DoD drives the quality of work and is used to assess when a User Story has been completed.

## Scrum Events

Prescribed events are used in Scrum to create regularity and to minimize the need for meetings not defined in Scrum. All events are time-boxed events, such that every event has a maximum duration. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.

### Sprint

The Sprint is an event in itself that contains all the work and all the other events that happen during the time-boxed period of development. Scrum Teams work in short timeframes called sprints. Sprints can be as short as one week or as long as one month. Sprints happen one right after the other, with no breaks, to maintain a steady project tempo.

Each sprint begins with a plan and ends with a review of the work completed and an additional review of the way in which the team worked together.

During each sprint, the entire Scrum Team works together to complete one or more increments of a larger overall product or project. Each completed increment must be potentially releasable, meaning that it could theoretically be delivered as is. In other words, each increment must be fully tested and fully approved by the end of the sprint.

**Cancelling a Sprint**: A Sprint can be cancelled before the Sprint time-box is over. Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint, although he or she may do so under influence from the stakeholders, the Development Team, or the Scrum Master.

A Sprint would be cancelled if the Sprint Goal becomes obsolete. This might occur if the company changes direction or if market or technology conditions change. In general, a Sprint should be cancelled if it no longer makes sense given the circumstances. But, due to the short duration of Sprints, cancellation rarely makes sense.

Other than the Sprint itself, which is a container for all other events, each event in Scrum is a formal opportunity to inspect and adapt something. These events are specifically designed to enable critical transparency and inspection. Failure to include any of these events results in reduced transparency and is a lost opportunity to inspect and adapt.

### 1. Sprint Planning

<p align="center"> <img width="" height="" src="https://www.techagilist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sprint-Planning.png"></p>

This is the event that kick starts each Sprint and is where the Product Owner and Development team discuss which Product Backlog Items (PBI’s) will be included in Sprint. While the Product Owner has the right to prioritize each PBI for potential inclusion in the Sprint, the Development team are encouraged to respond, raise issues and push back where necessary. The Development Team then forecasts how many PBI’s they can deliver in the Sprint, given their knowledge of velocity, resources and any factors which could influence the time and resources they have available.

The outcome of the Sprint Planning Meeting is to get a Sprint Goal and Sprint Backlog that everyone agrees is realistic and achievable.

Sprint Planning answers the following:

- _What can be delivered in the Increment resulting from the upcoming Sprint?_
- _How will the work needed to deliver the Increment be achieved?_

**Sprint Goal**\
The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of PB. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment. It is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Sprint Goal gives the Development Team some flexibility regarding the functionality implemented within the Sprint. As the Development Team works, it does so with the Sprint Goal always in mind.

### 2. Daily Scrum

Scrum seeks to efficiently use your time and resources and the Daily Scrum event is no exception. The Daily Scrum is time-boxed to 15 minutes. Standing up is not compulsory. However, many teams find this a useful technique to keep the meeting short and to the point.

The Daily Scrum is an opportunity for the Development Team to check-in, assess progress towards achieving the Sprint Goal and to review and plan their activities for the next 24 hours.

### 3. Sprint Review

A Sprint Review usually takes place on the last day of the Sprint and allows you the opportunity to show the “done” Increment to stakeholders (customers, management and anyone else considered relevant and interested). As well as demonstrating working features produced during the Sprint, you’re also after useful feedback that can be incorporated the Product Backlog that may help guide the work for future sprints. The PO has the option to release any of the completed functionality.

Though a demo might be part of this meeting, the primary purpose of the Sprint Review is the inspect and adapt capability provided by the discussion. The SM ensures that the event takes place and that attendees understand its purpose. The SM teaches everyone involved to keep it within the time-box.

### 4. Sprint Retrospective

The final meeting in the Sprint is the Sprint Retrospective. This is when the Scrum team reviews what could be improved for future Sprints and how they should do it. The ethos of Scrum dictates that no matter how good the Scrum team is, there will always be opportunity to improve and the Sprint Retrospective gives the team a dedicated time in which to identify, discuss and plan this. The meeting should be a collaborative effort, just like the entire Scrum Process.

During the Sprint Retrospective, the team discusses:

- What went well in the Sprint
- What could be improved
- What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint

By the end of the Sprint Retrospective, the Scrum Team should have identified improvements that it will implement in the next Sprint. Implementing these improvements in the next Sprint is the adaptation to the inspection of the Scrum Team itself. Although improvements may be implemented at any time, the Sprint Retrospective provides a formal opportunity to focus on inspection and adaptation.

Besides these official Scrum Events, there is also an activity that many Scrum Teams do, which is called Product Backlog Refinement (used to be called Grooming).

### 5. Backlog Refinement

The Backlog Refinement meeting (or backlog management meeting, or backlog grooming session) usually takes place towards the end of the current sprint.The purpose of the backlog refinement meeting is to decompose the highest priority items in the product backlog into user stories which are suitable for inclusion in the next sprint.

Attendance varies but certainly includes the Product Owner and the meeting is often facilitated by the ScrumMaster. What’s important is that representation of what is feasible, valuable and a good user experience are present. It is time-boxed, usually to no more than 2 hours for a two week sprint.

The benefits of having a separate backlog management meeting are threefold: it reduces the need for a long sprint planning meeting which can be hard to schedule and which can tax even the longest of attention spans. It also gives the team a chance to reflect on the backlog items discussed in the meeting before committing to the sprint backlog and sprint goal. And it offers greater flexibility to look a little further ahead.

## Summary

Ultimately, the core idea of Scrum is to create a process of constant feedback. So as long as you review and refine your goals on a consistent basis, you’ll be heading in the right direction.

Although the Scrum framework is relatively simple, it would be a mistake to assume that Scrum is easy and painless to apply. One way to make it easier to adopt and agile process like Scrum is to get the proper training and coaching along the way. But you must keep one thing in mind and that is Scrum is not a silver bullet or a magic cure. Scrum can, however, enable you to embrace the change that accompany all complex product development efforts.
