# Chapter 5 - Moderation

Moderation focuses on keeping the information and communication flow clear and accessible to all who participate. It aims at making use of group knowledge by involving group members in the decision-making process and by focusing them on the purpose of the meeting. It requires a specific basic attitude of the moderator and certain techniques. Let’s start with what and how to recognize a good event moderator.

## Moderator

A Moderator is someone who tries to help other people come to an agreement. They help the meeting group to achieve its goals in a focused manner. To guide the discussion in the proper direction, focus groups are typically led by at least one moderator. An event moderator is the master of ceremony of the event. He or she is there to make sure the speakers can do the best job and the audience gets the most out of the day or session. A moderator introduces speakers. He or she also makes sure the speakers stick to the time and the moderator asks and moderate questions. He or she is the connection between the different talks. Having a successful moderator can make a real difference in the effectiveness of a focus group. Let's see Scrum Master, as Moderator.

## Scrum Master as Moderator

As a moderator , the Scrum Master focuses on motivation , provides framework conditions and offers nothing more, but also nothing less than just support, and that in a culture of cooperation that is characterized by trust. During the individual activities (Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Daily Scrum, Sprint Retrospective, Product Backlog Refinement) the Scrum Master acts as a moderator. However, this depends on the type of meeting: while it should only be the development team that has a say in the daily scrum, the scrum master’s influence is much higher in the retrospective.\
He leads the meetings and optimizes their quality and efficiency in his role as an impartial service provider, but does not influence the content of the project. However, he mediates between the product owner and the development team if, for example, there are differences of opinion or other conflicts regarding the product backlog or the sprint backlog. In this respect, he also acts as a problem solver and ensures human cooperation.\
As a moderator SM knows many different formats for productive group work and can sometimes use them spontaneously in a situation. But what makes a good moderator?

### Signs of a Good Event Moderator

The SM as moderator thus focuses on the collaboration, addresses the group dynamics in the team, and researches with colleagues which behavior is efficient, appropriate, or inappropriate. If the SM wants to be a good moderator and want the event/ceremonies to be a success at a team meeting, you need to do certain things well. Let’s dive in! What are the most important moderation skills you need?

**1. Be prepared:** First, you want to be ready. Don’t show up without any preparation. The simplest thing here is to know the agenda. This will help you to plan your time, for example how early you’ll need to arrive, and will give you an idea of what’s expected on the day. It might be as simple as introducing some new techniques to the team, or facilitating audience questions, or it could be hosting a Sprint Retrospective.\
**2. Do your Research:** If you’re not familiar with the topic of the meeting, it’s worth spending some time reading up on it. This will give you an idea of the current challenges and developments in the industry.\
**3. Use questions wisely:** It’s your job to make sure the attendees get the most value out of the event. If a PO is quite taciturn, you’ll need to ask follow-up questions to get the full picture for the team. Questions can also be effectively used as moderator transitions to help keep the conversation on track. A few sample moderator questions are:

- Do you have an example of that?
- How does this relate back to the discussion?
- Can you explain that further?

It’s SM's job to write the questions for the Team or PO, remember it’s all about adding value. Questions that invite open-ended answers are best (rather than merely ‘yes’ or ‘no’)\
**4. Make the speakers the center of attention:** As a moderator, you are not the center of attention. The speakers are. The best moderators know how to take a step back. To shut up when needed. Always be aware of the fact that you should keep what you say as short as possible. Summarise what the speakers said. Ask short questions and repeat the questions from the team. That’s it.\
**5. Pay attention:** Being an event moderator is hard work! You are the only one who knows for sure that you need to pay attention. You want to know what happens and you want to make sure you ask the right questions. For that, you need to pay attention.\
**6. Be a host:** Finally, As a moderator, you are more than the person watching time. You are the person in charge of the session. Be attentive. Know who’s in front of you and make sure they have a productive session and that they get something out of the meeting.\
Now let us look at some characteristics of a great moderator.

## Characteristics of a Great Moderator

Perhaps the decisive achievement of moderation is therefore to move the colleagues in the teams from a technical understanding of the problem to a social understanding of the topics. To create this kind of mindset the SM needs to have these 8 most important qualities of a great moderator.

### 1. Natural curiosity:

To any true moderator, phrases like "I don't know," "I guess so" and "I'm not sure" creates great opportunities. No accomplished moderator will allow any of these answers to be the final word - they need to know more, they need to understand why, and they can help the team articulate their thoughts comfortably.

### 2. Ease in interacting with people:

They should be easily approachable and appreciate people and perspectives, and communicate empathically. Entry should be made easier for quieter participants; dominates are given a hint to become curious about the point of view of the others.

### 3. Ability to remain impartial, open, and unbiased:

SM supports each party to be heard and taken seriously by the others with their personal concerns. He/she gives a trustable working environment where all problems can be raised without fear.

### 4. Flexibility:

The Scrum Master should be flexible for adopting any change. There might be instances where things will not go as planned but as SM you should easily adapt the situation and help the team to find the best outcome from the meeting/ceremony.

### 5. Strong verbal skills:

Effective verbal communication skills include more than just talking. Verbal communication encompasses both how you deliver messages and how you receive them. SMs who can convey information clearly and effectively are highly valued by the team.

### 6. Creating comfort and trust:

One way to build trust is to encourage your team members to see their colleagues as people. Think about creating situations that help them to share personal stories, and to bond. Do this by sharing your personal stories and your weakness with them.

### 7. Be Enthusiastic and Attentive:

A good moderation believes in inherenting kinetic energy in every person, Have a high energy level, pay attention to participants and recognize team dynamics. Team dynamics is about managing the relationships and participation of team members.

### 8. Control communication during meetings

In a meeting, individuals come together in a group to talk about a topic. Consequently there are three dimensions - the I, the GROUP, the TOPIC - which the moderator must keep in a "dynamic balance". SM as a moderator constantly listens to the meta-level in which dimension a team member is expressing himself. With his interventions he ensures an appropriate dynamic balance and steers the conversation to the level that needs clarification at the moment.

"A good moderator is best when people hardly know that he exists. Not so good when people obey him and cheer. Bad if they despise him."

## Summary

At, last, Being a good event moderator isn’t easy. Even though many think they can ‘wing’ it, but the fact is that the good ones spend a lot of time preparing. In the end, if the moderator does a good job the team/group will be able to take a lot with them. We also answered the question “how to be a good moderator? It is, you need to have the right moderation skills. But most important: you need to make it work. We saw that SM also has to act as Moderator in many ceremonies. Lastly, a moderator is a glue that keeps the team together.
