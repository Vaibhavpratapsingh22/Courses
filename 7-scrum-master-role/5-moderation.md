# Chapter 5 - Moderation

A Moderator is someone who tries to help other people come to an agreement. Moderation is unconventionally regarded as a means of conducting meetings or group activities in a non-controlling manner. It aims at making use of group knowledge by involving group members in the decision-making process and by focusing them on the purpose of the meeting. The moderation requires a specific basic attitude of the moderator and certain techniques. Let’s start with what and how to recognize a good event moderator.

## What is an (event) moderator?

A moderator helps the meeting group to achieve its goals in a focused manner. To guide the discussion in the proper direction, focus groups are typically led by at least one moderator. An event moderator is the master of ceremony of the event. He or she is there to make sure the speakers can do the best job and the audience gets the most out of the day or session. A moderator introduces speakers. He or she also makes sure the speakers stick to the time and the moderator asks and moderate questions. He or she is the connection between the different talks.\
A Scrum Master knows many different formats for productive group work and can sometimes use them spontaneously in a situation. Having a successful moderator can make a real difference in the effectiveness of a focus group. But what makes a good moderator?

### How to be a good event moderator?

If you want to be a good moderator and want your event moderation to be a success at a team meeting or to moderate a conference, you need to do certain things well. Let’s dive in! What are the most important moderation skills you need?

**1. Be prepared:** First, you want to be ready. Don’t show up without any preparation. The simplest thing here is to know the agenda. This will help you to plan your time, for example how early you’ll need to arrive, and will give you an idea of what’s expected on the day. It might be as simple as introducing a few speakers and facilitating audience questions, or it could be hosting a Sprint Retrospective.\
**2. Do your Research:** If you’re not familiar with the topic of the meeting, it’s worth spending some time reading up on it. This will give you an idea of the current challenges and developments in the industry.\
**3. Use questions wisely:** It’s your job to make sure the attendees get the most value out of the event. If a speaker is quite taciturn, you’ll need to ask follow-up questions to get the full picture. Questions can also be effectively used as moderator transitions to help keep the conversation on track. A few sample moderator questions are:

- Do you have an example of that?
- How does this relate back to the discussion?
- Can you explain that further?

If it’s your job to write the questions for the team or speakers, remember it’s all about adding value. Questions that invite open-ended answers are best (rather than merely ‘yes’ or ‘no’)\
**4. Make the speakers the center of attention:** As a moderator, you are not the center of attention. The speakers are. The best moderators know how to take a step back. To shut up when needed. Always be aware of the fact that you should keep what you say as short as possible. Summarise what the speakers said. Ask short questions and repeat the questions from the audience. That’s it.\
**5. Pay attention:** Being an event moderator is hard work! You are the only one who knows for sure that you need to pay attention. You want to know what happens and you want to make sure you ask the right questions. For that, you need to pay attention.\
**6. Be a host:** Finally, As a moderator, you are more than the person watching time. You are the person in charge of the session. Be attentive. Know who’s in front of you and make sure they have a productive session and that they get something out of the meeting. Now let us look at some characteristics of a great moderator.

## Characteristics of a great moderator

The 7 most important qualities of a great moderator.

1. Natural curiosity: Phrases like “I don’t know,” “I guess so” and “I’m not sure” create great opportunities to any true moderator. No accomplished moderator will allow any of these responses to be the final word – they need to know more, they need to understand the whys, and they have the skill to help respondents comfortably articulate their thoughts.
2. Ease in interacting with people: They should be easily approachable and be empathetic while talking to others.
3. Ability to remain impartial, open, and unbiased: Check your opinions at the door. More important, perhaps, than being able to interact with people is not letting your biases show. Regardless of the topic or what respondents say, the moderator acts only as a sounding board.
4. Flexibility: No matter how well prepared the discussion guide is, or how familiar the moderator is with the topic, revelations coming from respondents create the need for additional or different question areas. Frequently, it is these bolts of brilliance that turn an ordinary group into an extraordinary group. However, it is up to the moderator to handle what pops up and work with it.
5. Strong verbal skills: Effective verbal communication skills include more than just talking. Verbal communication encompasses both how you deliver messages and how you receive them. Moderators who can convey information clearly and effectively are highly valued by the team.
6. Creating comfort and trust: When respondents feel comfortable, signs that a group is working are their body language, interest, involvement, and the number of times they laugh.
7. Be Enthusiastic and Attentive: Have a high energy level, pay attention to participants and recognize group dynamics.

## Scrum Master as Moderator

During the individual activities (Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, Daily Scrum, Sprint Retrospective, Product Backlog Refinement) the Scrum Master acts as a moderator. However, this depends on the type of meeting: while it should only be the development team that has a say in the daily scrum, the scrum master’s influence is much higher in the retrospective.\
He leads the meetings and optimizes their quality and efficiency in his role as an impartial service provider, but does not influence the content of the project. However, he mediates between the product owner and the development team if, for example, there are differences of opinion or other conflicts regarding the product backlog or the sprint backlog. In this respect, he also acts as a problem solver and ensures human cooperation.\
Also, the SM has the backing of the development team so that they can work independently and undisturbed during the sprints. As the interface between the team and the outside world, the SM is therefore also responsible for communication with “actors outside the project” such as stakeholders or management. If they could intervene in the individual project processes at any time, this would contradict the principles of agile project management.

## Summary

At last, Being a good event moderator isn’t easy. Even though many think they can ‘wing’ it, but the fact is that the good ones spend a lot of time preparing. In the end, if the moderator does a good job the team/group will be able to take a lot with them. We also answered the question “how to be a good moderator? It is, you need to have the right moderation skills. But most important: you need to make it work. We saw that Scrum Master also has to act as Moderator in many ceremonies. Lastly, a moderator is a glue that keeps the team together.
