# Chapter 3 - Facilitation

Facilitation very literally means “making things easier”, it allows us to arrive to a consensus for a common group without a feeling of compromise. Facilitation is about providing a proper group thinking environment where the participants can openly share their ideas, without the fear of being criticized. It is to make them Think about the problem and let them collaboratively make decisions to solve their problem.

Facilitation can be driven by an external role that is dedicated to facilitation (a facilitator) or by the group members themselves. let’s first discuss the art and science of facilitation.

## The Art and Science of Facilitation

Facilitation is both an art and a science. The science comes from what we know about how people think, how groups behave and teams develop. The art is how the facilitator learns to dance in the moment: seeing what’s happening in a group, hearing what’s behind the way the group talks with one another, listening for what’s not being said, and letting the magic of the group’s collective intelligence organically emerge.

Some Basic Premises of Facilitation:

1. The facilitator leads the discussion but does not dominate.
2. They are knowledgeable enough about a topic, to be able to provide guiding questions.
3. They should not provide an answer, but rather they let the team to find the answer themselves.
4. By providing a "Safe space" would be a vital key for a facilitator, Where all the voices are heard and given proper respect. It is important to inform the team that opinions are not “right” or “wrong”. Sometimes, they may have to help the group participants in determining their opinions. But how to do that, with this in mind, probing questions become more important.
5. They must have some “probing questions” ready when they see that the participants are less vocal. Asking them questions may get their thoughts going more around a topic. Coming into the facilitation session with these questions in your mind or on paper can help, they should make sure that discussion happens.

### Facilitation requires an understanding of the following:

- **Community**: What are the guiding norms of the community with whom you are facilitating a discussion?
- **Observation**: The facilitator becomes a guide on the journey with the group. By observing and reflecting while facilitating a discussion, the facilitator can support the group and notice what contributions she or he may need to make to assist participants in arriving at a turning point.
- **Flexibility**: Facilitators must be ready for non-linear discussion. People may go around and around. They may sit back and relax, but then all of a sudden become incredibly engaged. When facilitators are flexible, they can best guide discussion.
- **Imagination**: Facilitators permit participants to use their imagination to brainstorm. However, they fill an important role of grounding conversation when ideas become toot abstract or when time is of the essence.
- **Patience**: one of the most frustrating parts of facilitating a conversation, particularly when you are knowledgeable about a topic, is that you have to be patient and understand that it may take others longer to arrive at a conclusion. Facilitators cannot lose their cool or make quick judgments. They need to be patient.
- **Balance**: Effective facilitation balances the challenging and supportive of others. The voices of the individual and organization are heard and respected.
- **Affirmation**: Good facilitators affirm individuals and recognize the ideas of others. When participants let their barriers down and become themselves, this is an important step to affirm. You must also affirm yourself as a facilitator that you must be true.
- **Silence**: Arguably the hardest thing for a facilitator is to permit silence. Good facilitators make sure that all that are participating are INVOLVED. Those who are frequently silent need to be asked what their opinion is while maintaining respect for their silence.
- **Challenge**: They must challenge their participants to think differently and explore other options. Participants in the process of group discussion accept the challenge of owning the process. They are responsible for the discussion and must have ownership in making sure that all participants have a comfortable experience.
- **Connections**: As the facilitator connects with others and helps them connect with themselves, meaning begins to emerge. Facilitators will learn to recognize when participants begin to “get it”.

## Facilitator

A facilitator is an individual who uses self-awareness, self-management, group awareness, and group process to enable teams to understand and achieve their objectives by promoting collaboration, optimizing the process, and creating synergy within the team. In doing so, the facilitator remains "neutral", meaning he/she does not take a particular position in the discussion.

What a facilitator does is plan, guide and manage a group event to ensure that the group's objectives are met effectively, with clear thinking, good participation ,and full buy-in from everyone who is involved.

Unlike coaching, facilitation always involves a group of people, although the facilitated event can be used as an opportunity for the SM to coach the team to increase their effectiveness in collaborating in generating collective intelligence. Here, a question might arrive Why do we need a facilitator, this we will see in the next section.

### The need of a Facilitator

Maximizing collective intelligence comes at a cost because there will be many differences in the room. There will be people with different needs, that comes from different experience and background. There will be people with different views and thoughts that come from their different position and roles in the organization. Even though all voices must be heard but not all voice has the same scale of quality. A great SM can maximize collective intelligence from these differences and many voices. So we need facilitation because there are many voices and we want to maximize that into powerful collective intelligence. By default, the SM facilitates the Scrum events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospectives, or even a Product Backlog refinement session.

Facilitation matters. It is more than just sticky notes and dots for voting. It is a craft. Our reality is socially constructed, which means that how we talk to and with one another—the words we use, the way we speak, the metaphors that describe our ideas—all inform the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of our work. Teams do not typically have the ability or skill to talk with each other productively without practice. This is the promise of facilitation.

Now that we have discussed the why and the what, let’s discuss the flow of facilitation.

## The flow of a facilitated event

To facilitate an event well, you must first understand the group's desired outcome, and the background and context of the meeting or event.

### 1. The input

Effective facilitation requires knowing the input.

- We have to ensure no one in the room is hiding important information that may degrade the quality of the outcome of the facilitated event. This may be a PO who is holding a piece of information for her personal advantage. Or an architect who has been influenced by the CEO before the meeting begins.The challenge here as a SM we need to uphold the Scrum value of openness.
- In Scrum itself, there are boundaries such as a timebox. Some Scrum Teams may craft their own prime directives. Prime directives are a shared agreement to ensure that no one is stepping on each other's toe during the facilitated event. If there aren’t any, it is a good idea for the SM to start creating prime directives and remind everyone before a facilitated event starts.
- Before the event start, we need to understand what is the goal of the facilitated event. Scrum Teams who start their Sprint Planning with a Sprint Goal may use this as the goal of the Sprint Planning.
- The last thing that we need to understand is to understand the context of the event. Is it for generating a solution? Or just to generate ideas and explore new possibilities? Is it for alignment or is it a conflict between individuals? Without understanding the context of the facilitated event, we as a SM can not facilitate the event effectively.

### 2. The facilitated event itself

After all of the inputs are known and placed on the table, the facilitated event happens. After this facilitated event, the group should come up with choices to be made. In this facilitated event the SM must:

Keep everyone engaged. Being able to sense the room is very important for the SM to keep everyone engaged. Some questions the SM can ask when not everyone is fully engaged:

- Is the person who is not engaged should even be in the room? How can that person increase the quality of the discussion?
- Is there someone hi-jacking the whole event? Maybe the boss who tries to lead the team to think as he wants it to be?
- Is everyone's voice being heard? Are we undermining his/her voice because of his position or pay grade in the company?
- Did someone just change their behavior? Is everyone playing with their phones?

  Keep everyone focused. Keeping everyone engaged is very important, but oftentimes it is too easy for people to be sidetracked too far away and forget the first reason for being there. Some questions that the SM should ask:

- Is this topic still related to the goal or objective of us being here?
- How is the timebox? Are we close the timebox already? Should we push the discussion forward?
- Have we got enough choices for the group to decide?

  Stay neutral and unbiased. The SM must stay neutral and unbiased throughout the facilitated event otherwise it will lower the quality of the decision that will be made by the group. The SM must not have any interest or preferences in the solution offered by a group of people. The SM must focus on the idea given by the person rather than his/her position in the organization. The SM must not pick sides, for example favoring the solution from the boss because he/she is in the room or not listening to someone's idea because he/she is on the lower pay grade.

### 3. Free and Informed choices

Free choices mean that each choice placed on the table are testable by logics from people outside of the group. The choices are neither self-serving nor self-sealing certain individuals for their advantage. Informed choices mean that everyone understood that the choices are not generated under influence or even manipulation. Everyone understood that all choices are made with integrity given the situation. The SM needs that all of the choices are free and informed.

### 4. The outcome

The outcome of this facilitated event is a high-quality decision that is owned by everyone. What that means is everyone is holding each other accountable for the decision made. This high-quality decision is transparent to everybody and tangible, which means the quality of the decision can be measured.

A SM should facilitate by creating a "container" for the team to fill up with their ideas and innovations. The container, often a set of agenda questions or some other lightweight (and flexible) structure, gives the team just enough of a frame to stay on their purpose and promotes an environment for richer interaction, a place where fantastic ideas can be heard. The coach creates the container; the team creates the content." Now let us see some of the traits of a high-quality facilitator in the next section.

## Traits of a high-quality facilitator

So far we’ve discussed the flow of facilitation and we’ve learned that poor quality facilitator is one of the reasons the group of people came up with poor quality decisions. So what does a high-quality facilitator look like? Here are some qualities I found important to be an effective facilitator:

### 1. Trustworthy

That means SM act on integrity and is not easily swayed away by anyone. Let us look at an example here: Once Tim was been pushed to the wall by a middle-manager of his company once where he told Tim to hide important information during a facilitated event because if that information is exposed during the event it may risk his position.Hiding this information will lower the quality of the decision made. In this case, if Tim just listened and manipulate the event as he wants it to be, He will lose the trust of the team. A Scrum Master as a facilitator needs to be professional and stand on code-of-ethics.

### 2. Objective and neutral

Not only the SM should be trustworthy, but they must also be neutral and unbiased. What that means is that they should not have any self-interest in the outcome of the facilitated event and has no preferences offered by the team.

### 3. Has effective behavior

As a facilitator, the SM should have effective behavior. That means the SM is an excellent communicator, fluid, and creative throughout the facilitated event. Having effective behavior means that they do not bring their emotion to the facilitated event nor invite everyone to bring their emotions because emotions make the quality discussion looks fuzzy.

### 4. Ability to increase group effectiveness collaborating together

A great SM is not only facilitating the event to come up with a high-quality decision but at the same time, they also can increase the team's effectiveness collaborating during the facilitated events.\
This requires knowledge in group dynamics, knowing when something is outside of the group’s norm. For ex, when somebody in the room starts becoming silent after a word is being mentioned, what does that mean? Understanding group dynamics also mean at the same time the SM needs to be dynamic during the event and courageous to cancel her original plan for the event when something changes during the event. To be dynamic, the SM needs to have many facilitation tools under her belt!

### 5. Ability to create a mutual learning environment

A good SM can make every facilitated event as a mutual learning opportunity, whether that is a Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, the Daily Scrum, or even the non-built-in Scrum events. Every facilitated event is an opportunity for everyone to learn from each other.\
Many SM are only seen as the team’s babysitter or ceremony organizer because they do not know how to use every facilitated event as a mutual learning opportunity. And that is also a reason why many organizations view the SM becoming less valuable in the long run because they're not getting value from the SM.

These qualities will distinguish a great SM from a SM as an event organizer or SM as the master of ceremonies.

## How can you improve your facilitation skills?

So, until here we saw the structure of facilitation, but how can you get better at facilitating meetings? Here are some suggestions on how to improve:

1.  Over prepare: Make sure you know the meeting topics backward and forwards.
2.  Practice in a safe environment: Hold a mock facilitation session with a teammate.
3.  Co-facilitate with experienced facilitators: On-the-job learning from seasoned veterans is probably the most effective way to level up your skills and you will gain first-hand experience in observing how different strategies work to manage conversations.
4.  Take training: in meeting facilitation and emotional intelligence. These types of courses will help you get better at reading the room.
5.  Ask for feedback from other participants you trust on how you can smooth the rough edges.

## Summary

At the end of the day, facilitation is more of an art than a science. It is like a complex dance of polarities. The Facilitator should know the importance of why and how they are facilitating the event and who their audience is. All of these will help them to become high-quality facilitator. At last this is a continuous learning process and the more you do it, the more sophisticated your skills will become! In many ways, the best facilitation training is being on the job as a facilitator.
