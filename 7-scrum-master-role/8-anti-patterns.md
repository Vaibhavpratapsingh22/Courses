# Chapter 8 - Scrum Master Anti-Patterns

The keystone of the definition of the Scrum Master role is the servant leadership aspect. In most cases of SM anti-patterns, it is precisely this standard that an individual is not meeting.\
This chapter deals with some anti traits of a SM. Read on and learn in this article on Scrum anti-patterns how you can identify if your SM needs support from the team.

## Possible Reasons Why Scrum Masters Leave the Agile Path

The reasons why SM violate the spirit of the Scrum Guide are multi-faceted. They run from ill-suited personal traits via the pursuit of own agendas, to frustration with the team itself. Some often-observed reasons are:

**1. Ignorance or laziness:** One size of Agile fits every team. Your SM learned the trade in a specific context and is now rolling out precisely this pattern in whatever organization he or she is active, no matter the context.\
**2. Lack of patience:** Patience is a critical resource a successful SM needs to field in abundance. Of course, there is no fun in readdressing the same issue several times, rephrasing it properly, if the solution is so obvious—from the SM’s perspective. So, why not tell them how to do it ‘right’ all the time, thus becoming more efficient? Too bad, that Agile cannot be pushed but needs to be pulled.\
**3. Dogmatism:** Some SMs believe in applying the Scrum Guide literally which unavoidably will cause friction.\
**4. Laissez-faire turned into indifference:** Pointing the team in a direction where the team members themselves can find a solution for an issue is good leadership. Letting them run without guidance, however, quickly turns into indifference, or worse, into an I-do-not-care mentality.\
**5. Dolla, dolla bills ya’ll—the Scrum Master imposter:** Secretly, the SM is convinced that this Agile/Scrum thingy is a fad, but recognizes that it is a well-paid one: “I will weather the decline in demand for project managers by getting a SM certificate.” This conviction will, inevitably, bring out his or her true colors over time.\
**6. Pearls before swine — the frustrated Scrum Master:** The SM has been working his or her butt off for months, but the team is not responding to the effort. The level of frustration is growing. There are a lot of potential reasons for a failure at this level. If the Scrum team does not manage to turn the ship around the team will probably lose the SM. Note, that the SM cannot solve this issue by herself or himself. The cooperation of the team is required.\
**7. The rookie:** If you apply [Occam’s razor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occam%27s_razor) to the situation, you may also conclude that your SM has not yet defected to the dark side. He or she might merely be inexperienced. Given that we all need to learn new skills regularly, cut him or her some slack in this case, and reach out to support the effort.

## The SM as an Agile Manager

In my eyes, ‘agile management’ is an oxymoron. The primary purpose of any Agile practice is empowering those closest to a problem with finding a solution. In other words, the team shall become self-organizing over the course of time. Self-organizing teams need coaches, mentors, and (servant) leaders, however, not a manager in the Taylorist meaning of the word. Watch out for the SM anti-patterns corresponding to this ‘agile manager’ attitude:

**1. Agile management:** Self-organization does not mean the absence of management: why would a Scrum team assume, for example, responsibility for pay-role? Would that help with creating value for the customer? Probably not. Hence, being a self-organizing team does not mean the absence of management, per se. It does mean, however, that there is no need for micromanagement. The SM is not a supervisor.\
**2. Running meetings by allowing someone to speak:** When team members seek eye-contact with the SM before speaking out, the SM already left the facilitation role in favor of the supervisor mode.\
**3. Burn-down chart enforcer:** SM focuses his or her work on producing a daily update to the burn-down chart. However, if the burn-down is solely maintained to track the output for reporting purposes the team needs to challenge this attitude.

**4. Pursuing flawed metrics:** SM keeps track of individual performance metrics such as story points per developer per Sprint, probably to report to that person’s line manager. That is a classic supervisor hack to reintroduce command and control through the back door. It inevitably leads to cargo-cult Scrum.\
**5. Escalating under-performance:** SM reports to higher levels that the Scrum team will not meet the current Sprint commitment or forecast. I took this from a job offer I received: “You will coordinate and manage the work of other team members, ensuring that timescales are met and breaches are escalated.” Perhaps, we should also reintroduce running the gauntlet for underperformers while we are at it?\
**6. Focusing on team harmony:** The SM sweeps conflict and problems under the rug by not using retrospectives to address those openly. This behavior is often a sign of bowing to politics and instead using manipulation to meet organizational requirements that oppose Scrum principles and values. A ‘Scrum Master’ participating in cargo-cult Agile is again more of a supervisor than an Agile practitioner.\
**7. The Guardian:** The Scrum Master works primarily with his team, but always has a broader perspective. He always looks at the team in its environment. He thinks not only of his team, but also systemically and thereby helps to avoid local sub-optimization. This is the only way the team can optimize its value contribution to the big picture.

## Scrum Master Anti-Patterns by Scrum Ceremony

Scrum ceremonies are important elements of the agile software delivery process. They are not just meetings for the sake of having meetings. Rather, these scrum ceremonies provide the framework for teams to get work done in a structured manner, help to set expectations, empower the team to collaborate effectively, and ultimately drive results. Let's see what different kind of anti-pattern can SM while conducting these ceremonies.

### Scrum Master Anti-Patterns During the Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is the scrum ceremony designed to make sure the team is prepared to get the right things done every sprint. The following anti-patterns focus on the Sprint planning:

**1. Oversized Sprint backlog without objection:** The team regularly accepts more issues into the Sprint backlog than it can stomach without the SM's intervention. If at the end of a Sprint, 50% of all issues spill over to the next Sprint and this becomes a pattern then your team is not practicing Scrum.\
**2. Unrefined stories accepted into the Sprint backlog:** The SM does not address the acceptance of issues into the Sprint backlog, thus violating the team’s definition of ready. This is a sure way that the Scrum team will not deliver the Sprint goal, rendering a Scrum principle useless: providing a potentially shippable product increment at the end of the Sprint (this refers to regular work, not emergencies).\
**3. 100% utilization:** The product owner squeezes additional (functional) work into the Sprint Backlog, and the SM does not address the necessity of slack time. (The scrum team’s effectiveness will be significantly impeded if the team does not address technical debt every Sprint. It will also suffer if there is no time for pairing, for example. A level of 100% utilization always reduces the team’s long-term productivity. A utilization rate of 100% is classic Taylorist line management thinking.)

### Scrum Master Anti-Patterns During the Sprint

The Sprint is an event in itself that contains all the work and all the other events that happen during the time-boxed period of development. The following anti-patterns focus on the mishandling of the Sprint itself:

**1. Flow disruption:** The SM allows stakeholders to disrupt the flow of the Scrum team during the Sprint. There are several possibilities of how stakeholders can interrupt the flow of the team during a Sprint. Any of the examples will impede the team’s productivity. The SM must prevent them from manifesting themselves:

- The SM has a laissez-faire policy as far as access to the development team is concerned.
- The SM does not oppose line managers taking team members off the team and assigning them other tasks.
- The SM does not object when the management invites engineers to random meetings as subject matter experts.
- The SM turns a blind eye to mid-Sprint changes of the Sprint Backlog lacking the approval of Scrum team.
- Lastly, the SM allows either stakeholders or managers to turn the Daily Scrum into a reporting session.

**2. Assigning sub-tasks to developers:** The Scrum Master does not prevent the product owner or anyone else from assigning tasks directly to engineers. (The development team organizes itself without external intervention. And the Scrum Master is the shield of the team in that respect.)\
**3. Defining technical solutions:** The engineer turned Scrum Master and is now ‘suggesting’ how the Scrum team is implementing issues.\
**4. Lack of support:** The Scrum Master does not support team members that need help with a task. Often, development teams create tasks an engineer can finish within a day. However, if someone struggles with such a job for more than two days without voicing that he or she needs support, the Scrum Master should address the issue.\
**5. Excessive Tailoring:** While some deviation from the standard practices is usually not a big deal, excessive tailoring of the defined process in terms of scope and frequency can lead to problems such as change fatigue by the team. For example, constantly changing the duration of the sprints or sprint events, changing the location of daily Scrums, modifying the frequency of the backlog refinement meetings, etc.\
**6. Complacent with Status Quo:** A SM who doesn’t like change, or avoid change at all cost, will also create problems for the team.

### Scrum Master Anti-Patterns During the Retrospective

The final meeting in the Sprint is the Sprint Retrospective. This set of anti-patterns addresses the Sprint retrospective:

**1. Groundhog day:** The retrospective never changes in composition, venue, or length. There is a tendency in this case that the team will revisit the same issues over and over again – it’s groundhog day without the happy ending, though.\
**2. Let’s have it next Sprint:** The Scrum Master postpones the retrospective into the next Sprint. Beyond the ‘inspect and adapt’ task, the retrospective shall also serve as a moment of closure that resets everybody’s mind so that the team can focus on the new Sprint goal. That is the reason why we have the retrospective before the planning of the follow-up Sprint. Postponing it into the next Sprint may interrupt the flow of the team. It also delays tackling possible improvements by up to a Sprint.\
**3. No Retro:** The Scrum Master does not gather data during the Sprint that supports the team in the upcoming retrospective. This could also be a sign of frustration.\
**4. No Documentation:** The Scrum Master does not take minutes for later use. A retrospective is a substantial investment, and the Scrum team should take it seriously. Taking notes and photos supports this process.\
**5. No psychological safety:** The retrospective is an endless cycle of blame and finger pointing without intervention from the Scrum Master. The team wins together, and the team loses together. The blame game documents both the failure of the Scrum Master as the facilitator of the retrospective as well as the team’s lack of maturity and communication skills.\
**6. Bullying is accepted:** One or two team members are dominating the retrospective. This communication behavior is often a sign of either a weak or uninterested Scrum Master.\
**7. Stakeholder alert:** The Scrum Master permits stakeholders to participate in the retrospective. The retrospective is off-limits to stakeholders, and the Scrum Master needs to enforce this rule.

### Scrum Master Antipatterns that May Impair Your Team

**1. Competes Against Other Teams:** SM who attempt to motivate the team by citing the performance of other teams within the same program or organization. This is an easy trap to fall into, but is potentially very damaging to team morale.\
**2. Avoids Conflict:** It is human nature to feel a sense of security and safety, especially in a group setting. If the same issues/conflicts continue to surface within the team, it is very likely that the Scrum Master needs help to address them.\
**3. Assign Tasks to Team Members:** Another common mistake that Scrum Masters make is to assign specific tasks to team members instead of enabling them to take collective ownership of the work.

## Summary

There are plenty of possibilities to fail as a Scrum Master. Sometimes, it is the lack of organizational support. Some people are not suited for the job. Others put themselves above their teams for questionable reasons. Some Scrum Masters simply lack feedback from their Scrum teams and stakeholders. Whatever the case may be, though, try and lend your Scrum Master in need a hand to overcome the misery. Scrum is a team sport.
