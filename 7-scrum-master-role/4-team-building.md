# Chapter 4 - Team Building

Over the past few years, we've seen businesses moving away from competitive work environments to workplaces where collaboration and co-operation between staff is seen as the key to company-wide success. As part of this change more and more companies are undertaking regular team building activities. Improving productivity is one of the most common goals of team building activities.\
But Before we see what is team building, let's quickly recap on what is Team?

## What is Team?

A team is a group of individuals, all working together for a common purpose. The individuals comprising a team ideally should have common goals, common objectives, similar if not the same interests, thought processes, attitude, perception, and likings.\
An individual cannot perform all tasks on his own. He needs the support as well as the guidance of others to be excellent in whatever he does. Complex goals can easily be accomplished if individuals work together as a team.

## What is Team Building?

This is the process of turning a group of individual contributing employees into a cohesive team. A group of people organized to work together to meet the needs of their customers by accomplishing their purpose and goals.\
Team building is a technique used for improving the efficiency and performance of the workgroups through various activities. It involves a lot of skills, analysis and observation for forming a strong and capable team. The whole sole motive here is to achieve the organization's vision and objectives.

Looking at all the benefits of Team Building, you must be wondering, How to Build a Great Team?

### How to Build a Great Team?

Team building is not a one-time act. It is a step by step process which aims at bringing a desirable change in the organization. Teams are usually formed for a particular task or projects.\
Forming a great team requires a lot of skills and presence of mind. The person responsible for team building must be able to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the team members and create the right mix of people with different skill sets. He must focus on developing strong interpersonal relations and trust among the team members.\
They must encourage communication and interaction among the team members and also reduce stress with the help of various team-building activities. They must clearly define the goals and objectives of the organization to the team members.\
In Agile when you are starting a new project with a new team there is a special meeting which is held by Scrum Master and Product Owner with the team, the meeting is called as **Agile Project Kick-off Meeting**

## Agile Project Kick-Off Meeting

The term kick-off comes from sport, for example, the kick-off in football which means it's the beginning of the game. Agile Project kick-off is therefore the kick-off event with which the project begins.\
An effective kick-off meeting creates a shared understanding, synchronizes priorities, and establishes norms for the team.\
A Project Kick-off can be carried out in the following scenarios:

### When do you carry out a project kick-off?

**1. A new project or a new product development:** As already mentioned above, you should carry out a kick-off for new teams and new projects or product developments.\
**2. The team is changed significantly:** If a new team member joins a team, you will probably not hold your own kick-off meeting. However, you should ensure that the new team member is properly onboarded so that they can quickly integrate into the team. But if significantly more colleagues come to the team, it makes perfect sense to hold a kick-off meeting.\
**3. At least once a year:** It makes perfect sense to hold a kick-off workshop every year, ideally at the beginning of the year. Even if the team remains unchanged, you can check the team values ​​and rules in such a workshop or focus on new topics. If necessary, you can also adapt the product vision. Now let us look at what is discussed in the meeting?

### What’s Discussed in an Agile Kickoff Meeting?

**1. Conveying the vision and goals of the project:** Teams are characterized by common goals. The team must be aware of these goals. It is therefore important to make the goals from a business and customer perspective transparent to the new team. These goals are accompanied by the vision related to the product. The product vision thus serves as a guard rail for the project or product development. With every new feature, the team can check whether the feature contributes to the vision of the product. Ideally, a colleague from top management can clarify the importance and significance of the project topic from a business perspective and provide additional motivation.\
**2. Enthusiasm and motivation of those involved:** Products that inspire customers are only created when people are enthusiastic and motivated to work on these products. It is important to inspire and motivate those involved for the project. This can be done through the content and the product itself. However, it is important to give employees freedom and a certain degree of autonomy for decisions, especially with regard to the HOW of product development. Employees who can influence development with their expertise are more motivated to go the extra mile.\
**3. Getting to know the employees:** Often, employees come together on a new project who do not yet know each other and have never worked together. On the one hand, a kick-off is a good opportunity to get to know each other on a human level. On the other hand, the colleagues also get to know each other professionally and understand who has which skills and abilities.\
**4. Outline framework conditions:** Almost every project or every product development is influenced by certain framework conditions. This could be: Dependencies on other projects/products, Dependence on other departments, and Important dates during development (e.g. trade fairs)\
This also includes details and information on other market participants and competitors. All colleagues involved should be familiar with these framework conditions.\
**5. Determination of the manner of cooperation:** The entire team should agree on how they want to work together during the kick-off. These include: Definition of the procedure (e.g. Scrum, Kanban, etc.), Working agreements, Involvement of the customer, What are the expectations?, and Which employees are involved with which roles?\
As part of team building, you should work out and record the following things: List of team members with their roles and contact information, Team name, Team motto, Team values ​​(e.g. respect, trust, etc.), Rules of cooperation, How are decisions made in the team?, How should conflicts be resolved?, and How to Celebrate as a Team?.\
In the figure below, you can see a Team Canvas showing all the details which we discussed and you can also use something like this for your Team Kick-off meeting.

## Team Building Activities

With so many people working remotely now, Talking about Virtual Team building activities make sense, so here are different activities that you can use with your team.

### 1. Two truths and a lie

This activity you can do at the start of a virtual meeting to create quick, personal connections with your co-workers.\
Two truths and one lie is a classic icebreaker activity. Each team member presents three statements about themselves: two truths and one that is false. The team can then take turns to recognize what’s true and what the lie is.
After everyone has guessed, the speaker reveals their lie. To make the game even more fun, add some healthy competition with a points system that’s recorded digitally or by the manager with a pen and paper. The person with the most correct guesses will grab the win!

### 2. Community Coffee Breaks

A community coffee break is an easy but effective way to catch up with your team members. Schedule a 15-minutes period every day or week when folks on your team can join a video chat held via your team management software.\
Use those 15 minutes to enjoy a cup of coffee and talk. Your conversations can be work-related or they can be purely for fun and entertainment, just like they might be if you were having a coffee break at the office together.

### 3.The perfect vacation

This is another short activity that’s great for developing your team’s listening skills. Participants are asked to grab a partner each. For the next step, each duo gets on a personal call and tells their partner about their perfect vacation – if they had unlimited time and money. After everyone is done, all the team members’ get together on a call and try to explain their partner’s dream vacation as accurately as possible! Since you’re describing your partner’s vacation, you’re forced to really listen and might even realize how both of you share similar interests.\
There are a lot of different activities and games are available online which you can try with the team. One of the most important benefits of a properly planned team building activity is greater collaboration between employees. Collaboration is about knowing who has what knowledge (or can answer to a question), trusting them and their experience and being able to get access to that person when you need it.

## Making High Performing Teams

To make a high performing time you need a team which should possess all the skills necessary to get the job done and entails shared accountability. Here are some key elements which can be used to make a team perform at higher-level.

1. Build upon a solid foundation: Incorporating common values in Scrum teams is crucial to create a culture of work that is collaborative in the first place. It forms a solid foundation that brings together all team members and fosters integration. Collaboration simply means to work together to accomplish a task. By this we will create a team self-organizing and self-managing.
2. Establish strong engineering practices: Beyond keeping the team together, it's really important to build the sequence of the best engineering practices like code reviews, continuous integration and deployment, sharing the codebase between all the software developer's higher-level coding standard to which all the programmers adhere. High-performing Scrum teams are aware that strong engineering fundamentals are crucial for delivering great digital products.
3. Ensure continuous mentoring: To support individual team member’s development, there is a huge need for creating an environment where the peers can learn from each other. Pair-programming sessions, TILs, code reviews, and feedback - these are some of the instruments you can use daily as an encouragement to share the knowledge across the teams.
4. Create a cross-functional team: High-performing teams comprise individuals with a broad set of skills that are necessary to effectively accomplish the work from their backlog. Team members must be open and highly motivated and the team must have both the authority and the accountability to achieve the goals they have been given. The key aspect here is that the high-performance team should be able to deliver the results of their work by combining their respective skills and talents.
5. Communicate the big picture and goal: Team members work better when they know how their work is aligned with the overall goal and when it contributes to the bigger picture. It is not about picking up stories from the backlog without understanding what value it brings to the entire vision. This approach is not effective. It is important to invest time in communicating the bigger picture, the current priorities, and goals to the team to increase engagement and ownership.
6. Empower the team with decision-making: For the team to work effectively, the team members should be empowered to make their own decisions. The team needs to understand what work is to be done but they are given the freedom to find their own solutions and ways of working.\
   In essence, those six elements are crucial while setting-up the teams, however it takes some time and effort to build a high-performing team with the strong fundamentals and broad set of skills. There are some models through which you can identify how your team's development and how are they doing and in which state they are in. Let us see Tuckman's model of team development

### Tuckman's model of team development

Forming a team takes time, and members often go through recognizable stages as they change from being a collection of strangers to a united group with common goals. Agile/Scrum and other teams go through stages of development, and Bruce Tuckman established a popular framework on the subject. According to Tuckman, all phases—Forming, Storming, Norming, Performing and Adjourning—are necessary for the team to grow, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results.\
This model explains that as the team develops maturity and ability, relationships establish, and the leader changes leadership style.

<p align="center"> <img width="600" height="" src="https://blog.infodiagram.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gr_dev_1.jpg"></p>

The main task of a leader is to shorten the storming stage and prolong the performing stage as much as it’s possible. This is the key to high team performance. Still there might be some clear patterns in the behavioral tendencies which might stop the team to perform at their best level and to deal with those dysfunctions we have a model through which you can identify the problems the team is facing as SM and help the team to improve their performance. Let's have a look at the model

### 5 Dysfunctions of a Team model

The five dysfunctions are stacked in a pyramid and are hierarchical. Without building a strong foundation on the bottom, there is no achieving the higher-level goals.

## Summary

After all, what makes a good team great is the ability to focus on the common goal which brings all the team members together and increases their engagement, interactions and communication. It is also essential to instill positivity in team members and encourage them to share their knowledge and thoughts across the team. These are the fuels of productivity which help the team grow continuously.
