# Chapter 4 - Team Building

Over the past few years, we've seen businesses moving away from competitive work environments to workplaces where collaboration and co-operation between staff is seen as the key to company-wide success. As part of this change more and more companies are undertaking regular team building activities. Improving productivity is one of the most common goals of team building activities. But Before we see what is team building, let's quickly recap on what is Team?

## Team

A team is a group of individuals, all working together for a common purpose. The individuals comprising a team ideally should have common goals, common objectives, similar if not the same interests, thought processes, attitude, perception, and likings.\
An individual cannot perform all tasks on his own. He needs the support as well as the guidance of others to be excellent in whatever he does. Complex goals can easily be accomplished if individuals work together as a team.

## Team Building

This is the process of turning a group of individual contributing employees into a cohesive team. A group of people organized to work together to meet the needs of their customers by accomplishing their purpose and goals.\
Team building is a technique used for improving the efficiency and performance of the workgroups through various activities. It involves a lot of skills, analysis and observation for forming a strong and capable team. The whole sole motive here is to achieve the organization's vision and objectives.

Looking at all the benefits of Team Building, you must be wondering, How to Build a Great Team?

### Build a Great Team

Team building is not a one-time act. It is a step by step process which aims at bringing a desirable change in the organization. Teams are usually formed for a particular task or projects.\
Forming a great team requires a lot of skills and presence of mind. The person responsible for team building must be able to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the team members and create the right mix of people with different skill sets. He must focus on developing strong interpersonal relations and trust among the team members.\
They must encourage communication and interaction among the team members and also reduce stress with the help of various team-building activities. They must clearly define the goals and objectives of the organization to the team members.\
In Agile when you are starting a new project with a new team there is a special meeting which is held by Scrum Master and Product Owner with the team, the meeting is called as **Agile Project Kick-off Meeting.**

## Agile Project Kick-Off Meeting

The term kick-off comes from sport, for example, the kick-off in football which means it's the beginning of the game. Agile Project kick-off is, therefore, the kick-off event with which the project begins. So What's Purpose of Kick-off Meeting.

<p align="center"> <img width="700" height="" src="https://kissflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/kickoff-meeting-purpose.png"></p>

This Dilbert comic hilariously summarizes why every project needs to start with a kickoff meeting. It’s sometimes the case that projects don’t go through an organized sequence of planning and execution. Ill-prepared teams jump into the execution phase without a proper project plan and, as a result, the stakeholders have varied levels of understanding of the project’s purpose and vision. This is exactly what the kickoff meeting aims to prevent.\
An effective kick-off meeting creates a shared understanding, synchronizes priorities, and establishes norms for the team. A Project Kick-off can be carried out in the following scenarios:

Now let us look at what is discussed in the meeting?

### Discussion in an Agile Kickoff Meeting

<p align="center"> <img width="600" height="" src="https://kissflow.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/effective-kickoff-meeting.png"></p>
Please, not like this! An effective kickoff meeting establishes trust and transparency among the participants. It aligns everyone on the vision of the project and adds perspective for both team members and clients. Here's how you can run an effective kickoff meeting:

**1. Getting to know each other:** A kick-off is a good opportunity to get to know each other on a human level. Each person briefly describes what they did on their prior project, a personal success, and a professional success.\
**2. Enthusiasm and motivation of those involved:** Let everyone in the meeting know you appreciate their presence and you are grateful to have them on board and look forward to working together on the project. This makes people feel like they are important and sets a tone of professionalism and courtesy.
**3. Scope / Deliverables:** The product owner shares high-level goals for the project over the coming period. Everyone participates in describing and documenting how success will be defined.\
**4. Core and Desired Capabilities:** Each team member describes their core, existing capabilities followed by a list of any capabilities they would like to develop or improve during the coming project. This helps the team function as a collaborative unit throughout the project to get things done.\
**5. Collaboration & Communication Plan:** Participants discuss responsibilities for communicating with those outside the team. They then draf working agreements for how they will communicate and identify the role of any tools.\
**6. Risks:** An optional but sometimes important activity during which participants create a risk census, usually limited to a project’s top ten risks along with the impact and probability of each.\
**7. Wrap-Up:** This is an important part where you Thank participants for their time and attention. Ask them if their expectations for the meeting were met.\
By the end of the kickoff meeting, the team should have a very clear understanding of the project as well as their respective roles and responsibilities.

## Team Building Activities

The goal of team building activities and games is to help your team and organization. Build trust among team members, Increase the rapport and cohesiveness of team members, Increase group productivity, and effective communication. It helps to learn more about your team members on a personal and professional level.\

## Making High Performing Teams

To make a high performing time you need a team that should possess all the skills necessary to get the job done and entails shared accountability. Here are some key elements which can be used to make a team perform at higher-level.

<p align="center"> <img width="700" height="" src="https://workasavisual.files.wordpress.com/2019/09/9b3860a2-06ab-453a-9ba3-9ef7940969d5.png?w=1135"></p>
   In essence, those six elements are crucial while setting-up the teams, however it takes some time and effort to build a high-performing team with the strong fundamentals and broad set of skills. There are some models through which you can identify how your team's development and how are they doing and in which state they are in. Let us see Tuckman's model of team development.

### Tuckman's Model of Team Development

Forming a team takes time, and members often go through recognizable stages as they change from being a collection of strangers to a united group with common goals. Agile/Scrum and other teams go through stages of development, and Bruce Tuckman established a popular framework on the subject. According to Tuckman, all phases: Forming, Storming, Norming, and Performing are necessary for the team to grow, tackle problems, find solutions, plan work, and deliver results.\
This model explains that as the team develops maturity and ability, relationships establish, and the leader changes leadership style.

<p align="center"> <img width="600" height="" src="https://3back.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Tuckman-Model-of-Team-Formation-1024x802.jpg"></p>

The main task of a leader is to shorten the storming stage and prolong the performing stage as much as it’s possible. This is the key to high team performance. Still, there might be some clear patterns in the behavioral tendencies which might stop the team to perform at their best level and to deal with those dysfunctions we have a model through which you can identify the problems the team is facing as SM and help the team to improve their performance. Let's have a look at the model.

### 5 Dysfunctions of a Team Model

The five dysfunctions are stacked in a pyramid and are hierarchical. Without building a strong foundation on the bottom, there is no achieving the higher-level goals.

## Summary

After all, what makes a good team great is the ability to focus on the common goal which brings all the team members together and increases their engagement, interactions and communication. It is also essential to instill positivity in team members and encourage them to share their knowledge and thoughts across the team. These are the fuels of productivity which help the team grow continuously.
