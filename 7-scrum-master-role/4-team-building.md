# Chapter 4 - Team Building

Over the past few years, we've seen businesses moving away from competitive work environments to workplaces where collaboration and co-operation between staff is seen as the key to company-wide success. As part of this change more and more companies are undertaking regular team building activities. Improving productivity is one of the most common goals of team building activities.

But Before we see what is team building, let's quickly recap on what is Team?

## What is Team?

A team is a group of individuals, all working together for a common purpose. The individuals comprising a team ideally should have common goals, common objectives, similar if not the same interests, thought processes, attitude, perception, and likings.

An individual cannot perform all tasks on his own. He needs the support as well as the guidance of others to be excellent in whatever he does. Complex goals can easily be accomplished if individuals work together as a team.

Many people consider a group of people as a team but that's not true. There is a difference between a group and a team. A group is not necessarily a team. A group can have individuals with varied interests, attitude as well as thought processes. It is not always necessary that the group members would have a common objective or a common goal to achieve. On the other hand, A team must have individuals with a common objective to achieve. They should all work together and strive towards the achievement of a common goal. Now let's dive deep into how to build a team which can work towards a common goal.

## What is Team Building?

This is the process of turning a group of individual contributing employees into a cohesive team. A group of people organized to work together to meet the needs of their customers by accomplishing their purpose and goals.\
Team building is a technique used for improving the efficiency and performance of the workgroups through various activities. It involves a lot of skills, analysis and observation for forming a strong and capable team. The whole sole motive here is to achieve the organization's vision and objectives.\
Team building creates stronger bonds among the members of a group. The individual members respect each other and their differences and share common goals and expectations.\
It can help increase employee motivation and nurture a successful company culture in a number of ways. When a group of employees successfully complete a team-building activity it creates momentum and makes them feel good about themselves - it increases employees’ confidence in their, and their team’s, ability and it also shows employees that the organization is willing to invest in them.

Looking at all the benefits of Team Building, you must be wondering, How to Build a Great Team?

### How to Build a Great Team?

Team building is not a one-time act. It is a step by step process which aims at bringing a desirable change in the organization. Teams are usually formed for a particular task or projects.\
Forming a great team requires a lot of skills and presence of mind. The person responsible for team building must be able to find out the strengths and weaknesses of the team members and create the right mix of people with different skill sets. He must focus on developing strong interpersonal relations and trust among the team members.\
They must encourage communication and interaction among the team members and also reduce stress with the help of various team-building activities. They must clearly define the goals and objectives of the organization to the team members.\
In Agile when you are starting a new project with a new team there is a special meeting which is held by Scrum Master and Product Owner with the team, the meeting is called as **Agile Project Kick-off Meeting**

## Agile Project Kick-Off Meeting

The term kick-off comes from sport, for example, the kick-off in football which means it's the beginning of the game. Agile Project kick-off is therefore the kick-off event with which the project begins.\
An effective kick-off meeting creates a shared understanding, synchronizes priorities, and establishes norms for the team.\
A Project Kick-off can be carried out in the following scenarios:

### When do you carry out a project kick-off?

**1. A new project or a new product development:** As already mentioned above, you should carry out a kick-off for new teams and new projects or product developments.\
**2. The team is changed significantly:** If a new team member joins a team, you will probably not hold your own kick-off meeting. However, you should ensure that the new team member is properly onboarded so that they can quickly integrate into the team. But if significantly more colleagues come to the team, it makes perfect sense to hold a kick-off meeting.\
**3. At least once a year:** It makes perfect sense to hold a kick-off workshop every year, ideally at the beginning of the year. Even if the team remains unchanged, you can check the team values ​​and rules in such a workshop or focus on new topics. If necessary, you can also adapt the product vision. Now let us look at what is discussed in the meeting?

### What’s Discussed in an Agile Kickoff Meeting?

**1. Conveying the vision and goals of the project:** Teams are characterized by common goals. The team must be aware of these goals. It is therefore important to make the goals from a business and customer perspective transparent to the new team. These goals are accompanied by the vision related to the product. The product vision thus serves as a guard rail for the project or product development. With every new feature, the team can check whether the feature contributes to the vision of the product. Ideally, a colleague from top management can clarify the importance and significance of the project topic from a business perspective and provide additional motivation.\
**2. Enthusiasm and motivation of those involved:** Products that inspire customers are only created when people are enthusiastic and motivated to work on these products. It is important to inspire and motivate those involved for the project. This can be done through the content and the product itself. However, it is important to give employees freedom and a certain degree of autonomy for decisions, especially with regard to the HOW of product development. Employees who can influence development with their expertise are more motivated to go the extra mile. However, this should not be permanent.\
**3. Getting to know the employees:** Often, employees come together on a new project who do not yet know each other and have never worked together. On the one hand, a kick-off is a good opportunity to get to know each other on a human level. On the other hand, the colleagues also get to know each other professionally and understand who has which skills and abilities.\
**4. Outline framework conditions:** Almost every project or every product development is influenced by certain framework conditions. This could be:

- Dependencies on other projects/products
- Dependence on other departments
- Important dates during development (e.g. trade fairs)

This also includes details and information on other market participants and competitors. All colleagues involved should be familiar with these framework conditions.\
**5. Determination of the manner of cooperation:** The entire team should agree on how they want to work together during the kick-off. These include:

- Definition of the procedure (e.g. Scrum, Kanban, etc.)
- Working agreements
- Involvement of the customer
- What are the expectations?
- Which employees are involved with which roles?

Especially when team members are confronted with agile procedures for the first time, it is extremely important to take away colleagues' fears. Often a dangerous half-knowledge and myths about Scrum or Kanban buzz around the room.

As part of team building, you should work out and record the following things:

1. List of team members with their roles and contact information
2. Team name
3. Team motto
4. Team values ​​(e.g. respect, trust, etc.)
5. Rules of cooperation
6. How are decisions made in the team?
7. How should conflicts be resolved?
8. To Celebrate as a Team

In the figure below, you can see a Team Canvas showing all the details which we discussed and you can also use something like this for your Team Kick-off meeting.

## Team Building Activities

With so many people working remotely now,

One of the most important benefits of a properly planned team building activity is greater collaboration between employees. Collaboration is about knowing who has what knowledge (or can answer to a question), trusting them and their experience and being able to get access to that person when you need it.\
