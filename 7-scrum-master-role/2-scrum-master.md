# Chapter 2 - Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for the Scrum process and its correct implementation. He supports and mediates between the various roles and, in addition to maximum benefit, strives to continuously optimize the process. One of his main tasks is to remove obstacles and ensure the flow of information between the product owner and the team. He keeps an eye on the topicality of the Scrum elements and protects the team from unauthorized interventions during the sprint.

Other tasks in day-to-day business are, to conduct retrospectives with the whole team and in individual discussions, to set up team rules and ensure compliance with them, to recognize and moderate conflicts and to establish acceptance for the process throughout the company. Good SMs are committed to the scrum foundation and values, but remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow.

## Roles of a Scrum Master

The Scrum Master helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. SMs hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself. (ref.

## Scrum Master Focus Areas

Scrum Master has four focus points: This is divided into two parts, first part is called as Team Coaching, which is focused on (1) The Development team and (2) Product Owner. The second part is called as System's coaching which focuses on (3) Organisation and (4) Development Practices.

Let's take a look at this chart and the logic behind.

### Team Coaching

Team coaching helps teams reach their goals, while creating a sustainable environment that cultivates long-term excellence and success. The team coaching process helps teams align around a common purpose, establish inspiring spirit and vision, define clear roles, commit to team accountability, make powerful choices and take affirmative action.

1. **Focus on Team**\
   He should be able to influence the team in adapting the proper mindset of how the team should work and deliver items efficiently, reducing wastes as much as possible, without sacrificing any other elements of the user stories. One of the keywords for the mindset with respect to agile is being open on changes and trying ideas or suggestions by the team. They should be able to move further away on the mindset that “this is already working, why change it” or “I feel it’s not gonna work” or “I have been doing this for n years and I have been successful, why should I do that?” and go try a suggested approach or idea and have the positive attitude to help or tweak it to become even better.

   The initial focus of a SM towards the team(s) is high, but it should decline over time. When the teams are formed, the SM spends a lot of effort on educating and coaching the team(s) in self-management and taking on a shared responsibility. Over time, the team(s) rely less on their SM as they take on all responsibility by themselves.

2. **Focus on the Product Owner**\
   Initially, the SM focus towards the PO is coaching him in the role. This includes education on how they can best use the Product Backlog, facilitation of his interaction with the team(s), and being there to help him reflect. Don’t focus only on the PO-Teams relationship. The other PO relationships also need the support of a SM. Let’s explore these:

   The SM helps the PO getting closer to real users and customers. The PO needs feedback from them to validate the direction of the product. It also happens that the PO is the ‘wrong’ PO; then the SM should help the organization to find the ‘right’ PO who is close to users and customers.

   The SM helps to build up a relationship of trust, equality, and cooperation. This is hard work as historically this relationship is fraught with opacity, blame, and distrust.

SM should re-visit the approach if there are no change or small improvements after a dozen of sprints. One way to track is through observation as sprint goes by and constant communication. If the SM has evaluate that both the PO and team are self-sustaining, it is time to look on the second section.

### System Coaching

A System Coach is skilled in understanding the entire lifecycle of a product and how an organization can benefit from coordination and collaboration between teams, not only delivery teams but functional teams across the business.

3. **Focus on the Organization**\
   For the SM it is about observing outside the scrum team and product owner and begin reviewing the organisation as a whole and what can be improved or added or implemented (possible process that started in the team which can benefit other teams or departments). I personally think that this section requires SMs to swarm with other SMs to share methods, insights or even issues that will help the other, same as learn. It is at this section wherein SMs will have a larger time frame in evaluating what to do next, specially when he already sees what to improve on or the issue in the organization.

4. **Focus on the Development Practices**\
   This refers to the different practices that can be implemented based on collective observation and decision between the organization or in the team itself. In order to provide insight of any practices, one must learn or analyze before proposing it, especially to a large team. The focus of SM on Development Practices go high as the Scrum Team becomes self facilitating because as parts of system evolve in the right direction, it is important that a system as whole also prepares in the right direction. This is extremely essential to sustain the dynamics.

As the system evolves, the role of SM also evolves from a Team Coach to an Enterprise Coach and the focus area changes as well.

Now the question comes to the mind is How to measure the performance of a SM? Is there any metrics for doing this, and the answer to this question is Yes. In the upcoming topic, I would give you some metrics through which you can measure the performance of your SM.
