# Chapter 2 - Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for the Scrum process and its correct implementation. He supports and mediates between the various roles and, in addition to maximum benefit, strives to continuously optimize the process. One of his main tasks is to remove obstacles and ensure the flow of information between the product owner and the team. He keeps an eye on the topicality of the Scrum elements and protects the team from unauthorized interventions during the sprint.

Other tasks in day-to-day business are, to conduct retrospectives with the whole team and in individual discussions, to set up team rules and ensure compliance with them, to recognize and moderate conflicts and to establish acceptance for the process throughout the company. Good SMs are committed to the scrum foundation and values, but remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow.

## Roles of a Scrum Master

The Scrum Master helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. SMs hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself. (ref.

## Scrum Master Focus Areas

Let's take a look at this chart and the logic behind.

### Focus on Team

He should be able to influence the team in adapting the proper mindset of how the team should work and deliver items efficiently, reducing wastes as much as possible, without sacrificing any other elements of the user stories. One of the keyword for the mindset with respect to agile is being open on changes and trying ideas or suggestions by the team. They should be able to move further away on the mindset that “this is already working, why change it” or “i feel it’s not gonna work” or “I have been doing this for n years and i have been successful, why should I do that?” and go try a suggested approach or idea and have the positive attitude to help or tweak it to become even better.

The initial focus of a SM towards the team(s) is high, but it should decline over time. When the teams are formed, the SM spends a lot of effort on educating and coaching the team(s) in self-management and taking on a shared responsibility. Over time, the team(s) rely less on their SM as they take on all responsibility by themselves.

### Focus on the Product Owner

Initially, the SM focus towards the PO is coaching him in the role. This includes education on how they can best use the Product Backlog, facilitation of his interaction with the team(s), and being there to help him reflect. Don’t focus only on the PO-Teams relationship. The other PO relationships also need the support of a SM. Let’s explore these:

The SM helps the PO getting closer to real users and customers. The PO needs feedback from them to validate the direction of the product. It also happens that the PO is the ‘wrong’ PO; then the SM should help the organization to find the ‘right’ PO who is close to users and customers.

The SM helps to build up a relationship of trust, equality, and cooperation. This is hard work as historically this relationship is fraught with opacity, blame, and distrust.

SM should re-visit the approach if there are no change or small improvements after a dozen of sprints. One way to track is through observation as sprint goes by and constant communication. If the SM has evaluate that both the PO and team are self-sustaining, it is time to look on the second section.
