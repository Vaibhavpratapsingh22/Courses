# Chapter 2 - Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for the Scrum process and its correct implementation. He supports and mediates between the various roles and, in addition to maximum benefit, strives to continuously optimize the process. One of his main tasks is to remove obstacles and ensure the flow of information between the product owner and the team. He keeps an eye on the topicality of the Scrum elements and protects the team from unauthorized interventions during the sprint.

Other tasks in day-to-day business are, to conduct retrospectives with the whole team and in individual discussions, to set up team rules and ensure compliance with them, to recognize and moderate conflicts and to establish acceptance for the process throughout the company. Good SMs are committed to the scrum foundation and values, but remain flexible and open to opportunities for the team to improve their workflow.

## Roles of a Scrum Master

The SM helps the Scrum Team perform at their highest level. They also protect the team from both internal and external distractions. SMs hold the Scrum Team accountable to their working agreements, Scrum values, and to the Scrum framework itself. (ref. [Ch.1](https://github.com/Vaibhavpratapsingh22/Courses/blob/master/7-scrum-master-role/1-scrum.md))

For many Scrum Masters, protecting means shielding the team from outside distractions and interferences. These distractions and interferences come in different forms but most of them are from other humans. Here are the most common ones:

The “trespassers” have lost their voice of influence on a product or project. This may be a senior leader with a history of ownership on a product. As an organization grows, there is a need for them to relinquish control over their product but this is often a challenge for many senior leaders. They feel the need to strongly interject their opinions on the direction of a product vision or backlog. For the product owner, this leads to a lack of autonomy and a feeling of frustration. For the senior leader, this leads to intruding on product owner territory to get their ideas heard.

The “uninvited guests” have lost their assignment to direct the team. This is typically a manager with direct reports on the team. Prior to agile, they would be the ones who would assign work to the team and would always know what the team was doing. Status reports often originate from the uninvited guests (who are now looking from the outside in).

The “requestors” have lost their direct connection to team. This is typically a business person who in the past, had the ear of a developer and now must bypass the product owner. When something needs to be fixed or tweaked, a quick call to the developer and in just a few minutes the changes were made. This behavior often continues even after a team has assigned a product owner.

Now let's have a look at the services which are offered by SM to the team and organziation:

1.  **Service to the Product Owner**

    - Ensuring that goals, scope, and product domains are understood by everyone on the Scrum Team as well as possible
    - Finding techniques for effective Product Backlog management
    - Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items
    - Understanding product planning in an empirical environment
    - Ensuring the PO knows how to arrange the Product Backlog to maximize value
    - Understanding and practicing agility
    - Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed

2.  **Service to the Development Team**

    - Coaching the Development Team in self-organization and cross-functionality
    - Helping the Development Team to create high-value products
    - Removing impediments to the Development Team’s progress
    - Facilitating Scrum events as requested or needed
    - Coaching the Development Team in organizational environments in which Scrum is not yet fully adopted and understood

3.  **Service to the Organization**

    - Leading and coaching the organization in its Scrum adoption
    - Planning Scrum implementations within the organization
    - Helping employees and stakeholders understand and enact Scrum and empirical product development
    - Causing change that increases productivity
    - Working with other SMs to increase the effectiveness of the application of Scrum in the organization.

## Scrum Master Responsibility

The scrum master is the team role responsible for ensuring the team lives agile values and principles and follows the processes and practices that the team agreed they would use. The responsibilities of this role include:

- Clearing obstacles
- Establishing an environment where the team can be effective
- Addressing team dynamics
- Protecting the team from outside interruptions and distractions.

## Scrum Master Focus Areas

SM has four focus points: This is divided into two parts, first part is called as Team Coaching, which is focused on (1) The Development team and (2) Product Owner. The second part is called as System's coaching which focuses on (3) Organisation and (4) Development Practices.

<p align="center"> <img width="" height="" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/63605352/90793093-96a89f00-e30b-11ea-8dae-08e9dc0ba567.png"></p>

Let's take a look at this chart and the logic behind.

### 1. Team Coaching

Team coaching helps teams reach their goals, while creating a sustainable environment that cultivates long-term excellence and success. The team coaching process helps teams align around a common purpose, establish inspiring spirit and vision, define clear roles, commit to team accountability, make powerful choices and take affirmative action.

1. **Focus on Team**\
   He should be able to influence the team in adapting the proper mindset of how the team should work and deliver items efficiently, reducing wastes as much as possible, without sacrificing any other elements of the user stories. One of the keywords for the mindset with respect to agile is being open on changes and trying ideas or suggestions by the team. They should be able to move further away on the mindset that “this is already working, why change it” or “I feel it’s not gonna work” or “I have been doing this for n years and I have been successful, why should I do that?” and go try a suggested approach or idea and have the positive attitude to help or tweak it to become even better.

   The initial focus of a SM towards the team(s) is high, but it should decline over time. When the teams are formed, the SM spends a lot of effort on educating and coaching the team(s) in self-management and taking on a shared responsibility. Over time, the team(s) rely less on their SM as they take on all responsibility by themselves.

2. **Focus on the Product Owner**\
   Initially, the SM focus towards the PO is coaching him in the role. This includes education on how they can best use the Product Backlog, facilitation of his interaction with the team(s), and being there to help him reflect. Don’t focus only on the PO-Teams relationship. The other PO relationships also need the support of a SM. Let’s explore these:

   The SM helps the PO getting closer to real users and customers. The PO needs feedback from them to validate the direction of the product. It also happens that the PO is the ‘wrong’ PO; then the SM should help the organization to find the ‘right’ PO who is close to users and customers.

   The SM helps to build up a relationship of trust, equality, and cooperation. This is hard work as historically this relationship is fraught with opacity, blame, and distrust.

SM should re-visit the approach if there are no change or small improvements after a dozen of sprints. One way to track is through observation as sprint goes by and constant communication. If the SM has evaluate that both the PO and team are self-sustaining, it is time to look on the second section.

### 2. System Coaching

A System Coach is skilled in understanding the entire lifecycle of a product and how an organization can benefit from coordination and collaboration between teams, not only delivery teams but functional teams across the business.

3. **Focus on the Organization**\
   The Focus of SM on the organization is initially high because focusing only on the team is going to create local optimization, and SM also needs to understand the system first in which his team is gonna work. Once,he is familiar with the system - he reduces the attention from there and focuses on team back. Working with the leadership to create an organization that supports autonomy, cross-functionality, and, iterative development as it is very essential initially as a result of this, the focus of SM shifts from coaching the PO and Development Team. For the SM it is about observing outside the scrum team and product owner and begin reviewing the organization as a whole and what can be improved or added or implemented (possible process that started in the team which can benefit other teams or departments). I personally think that this section requires SMs to swarm with other SMs to share methods, insights or even issues that will help the other, same as learn. It is at this section wherein SMs will have a larger time frame in evaluating what to do next, specially when he already sees what to improve on or the issue in the organization.

4. **Focus on the Development Practices**\
    This refers to the different practices that can be implemented based on collective observation and decision between the organization or in the team itself. In order to provide insight of any practices, one must learn or analyze before proposing it, especially to a large team. The focus of SM on Development Practices go high as the Scrum Team becomes self facilitating because as parts of system evolve in the right direction, it is important that a system as whole also prepares in the right direction. This is extremely essential to sustain the dynamics. \
    Here are some best practices for Scrum implementation: Integrate Continuously, Collaborate, Engineering Practices, Hackathons, and, Mob Programming.\
   As the system evolves, the role of SM also evolves from a Team Coach to an Enterprise Coach and the focus area changes as well.

Now the question comes to the mind is How to measure the performance of a SM? Is there any metrics for doing this, and the answer to this question is Yes. In the upcoming topic, I would give you some metrics through which you can measure the performance of your SM.

## Scrum Master Performance Metrics

Measuring the performance of SM is not an easy job, It's like measuring a psychotherapist without knowing what and how they are doing! You can't just measure your SM the same way you do with others. It's just a totally different kind of job. And by measuring it the way you get used to you only bringing harm and decreasing their effectiveness. Here we will discuss different KPIs (Key Performance Indicator):

1. **SATISFACTION**\
   First one is Satisfaction metric, this we can measure by How happy is the Scrum Team and what is the trend? It's no longer a secret these days that people's satisfaction is the best indicator of future performance. You can use the satisfaction metric over a longer period of time to ensure that the SM supports the team in growing and makes the life of the Scrum Team in the company easier.\
   Let's look at the metrics: _What?_ Increase of Individual and team happiness.\
   _Why?_ Improve team performance
   _How?_ Daily happiness index on the door or happiness radar at the end of sprint. This is generally tracked using NIKO calender.

2. **CUSTOMER VALUE**\
   This metric deals with how do you measure the value towards your customer. Let's have a look at the metric: _What?_ Increase in Customer value\
   _Why?_ Foster feedback culture & focus on customer satisfaction\
   _How?_ Option 1: Stakeholder feedback in Sprint Review & Option 2: Net Promoter Score
   <p align="center"> <img width="" height="400" src="https://cdn2.vectorstock.com/i/1000x1000/27/06/net-promoter-score-formula-with-promoters-vector-21302706.jpg"></p>
3. **PREDICTABILITY**\
   Through this metric we can have a look at What did the Scrum Team commit to during the sprint planning, how much they actually going to deliver and how much did they actually deliver at the end of the Sprint. So let's have a look why and how can we do that: _What?_ Improvement of predictability\
   _Why_ Improve on living the Scrum value i.e Commitment\
   _How?_ Commitment during Sprint Planning vs. finished deliverables at the end of the Sprint\
   For ex. Team made a commitment of 20 Sp vs. Delivered 16 Sp
   This can help the organization to identify how much is the Scrum Team committed to the Sprint goal.
4. **STABILITY AND THE TREND TOWARDS THE DELIVERY OF FUNCTIONAL SOFTWARE**\
   This is an important metric, through which you can measure, _What?_ is the success rate of delivering working software at the end of a sprint? You could simplify that notion to the number of stories you deliver to your customer every week. If you don't deliver, you've accomplished nothing. Also note that word, _valuable_. The rate of delivery is meaningless if the software isn’t valuable to the users.\
   _Why?_ At the end of the day, if you can’t identify the outcome that benefits the business, then creating software for the sake of software is a waste of company money. Every member of the team should be fully versed and informed of how every item in every sprint contributes to an outcome that has business value.
   _How?_ To measure this type of metric, survey the team to be sure everyone has the same understanding. Some teams even use a point system to track and reward. Usually, there is a direct correlation between those who actively listen and ask questions.

5. **COST OF DELAY**\
   Through this metric we can have a look at how much money we could or we have saved by removing impediments.
   _What?_ Reduce waste in the organization\
   _Why?_ Increase productivity of the team and value flow within the organization\
   _How_ € saved by removing impediments
   <p align="center"> <img width="" height="" src="https://www.scaledagileframework.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/WSJF_F02-WP2.png"></p>
6. **ROI OF A SCRUM MASTER**\
    Here, we will see how to track the results through which SMs can be held accountable. Let us see the metrics:\
    _What?_ Increase the meeting efficiency\
    _Why?_ Facilitation of Meetings\
   _How?_ Cost of average team member \* minutes saved due to meetings becoming more efficient = how much money the SM is saving the organization
   For ex. 40000€ \* 20min = 8000000€ saved by SM for the organization.
7. **INTERNAL COST**\
 Let's see how much internal cost are SM decreasing: _What?_ Decrease of internal cost\
 _Why_ Increase the productivity of the Scrum Team\
 _How?_ € per story point = costs per sprint /amount of story points achieved\
 For Ex:- €12 000 per 2-week sprint cost(assuming 8 hours a day)/ 15 (approx) = 800€ per story points can be saved by increasing the productivity of the Scrum Team.
   <p align="center"> <img width="" height="" src="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Hazura_Zulzalil/publication/235009023/figure/fig2/AS:667777438339102@1536221956757/elocity-graph-in-agile-Figure-1-shows-velocity-of-an-agile-team-in-10-iterations.ppm"></p>
All in all, the best KPI is how quickly the SM Master can make himself superfluous without him or she losing value. If the Scrum Team works really self-organized over time and does not need the SM because the team members themselves behave like a SM, then the SM has achieved his goal!

## Summary

To summarize, Scrum Master acts as the protector of the team, making sure that everyone is on the right track, and the project is up and running. Scrum master plays a pivotal role in balancing the interests of the other two scrum-roles: the product owner and the development team. To balance these two different forces, the Scrum Master should be cooperative and supportive. Usually, the Scrum Master doesn’t stand between the product owner and the team, rather he/she helps in developing clear communication and results in timely and high-quality project deliveries.

In this article, I've presented ideas and suggestions for devising metrics to measure the performance of the scrum master. Many of these can be captured, reported, and analyzed within the tools and processes the teams are already employing for their development work.

Lastly, my two scents for SMs, Working software that adds value and satisfies the customer is what really counts. The team's success is the SM success - one does not succeed without the other.
