# Chapter 9 - Remote Work

The corona crisis has us firmly under control and companies are sending their employees to the home office to work from there. Do you and your colleagues suddenly have to work from home? You must be thinking how can Scrum work and what does it take to make the team effective in the remote setup? To address this issue, first let's see the difference between working with remote vs. co-located teams.

## Remote vs. Co-located

The general intention for Scrum teams is that they are working in the same physical location, often called collocation, or being co-located. Personal relationships are formed face to face, so that aspect is also strengthened by working in the same physical location. There is a lot more to it though. So let’s explore what science has to say about the real benefits of working in the same location?

### Co-located Work

Collocation means members of the same development team that are located at the same physical location where face-to-face collaboration among the team members is possible and practiced. Team members seated in the same room may ask one another questions. The answers to which other members of the team may tune in to, contributing to a discussion where the topic is relevant to their work.

They benefit from instant feedback cycles and can hold impromptu meetings, which means they can more quickly smooth over misunderstandings and pick up the pace on quick deadlines. Also, employees don’t have to worry about persistent technical breakdowns, such as wifi outages and video call issues.

### Remote Work

Remote work is a working style that allows professionals to work outside of a traditional office environment. It is based on the concept that work does not need to be done in a specific place to be executed successfully.\
It allows individuals work with a flexible schedule and the ability to work anywhere, many people love virtual employment so much they hope to continue working remotely for the rest of their careers.\
Now because of the pandemic, Remote work is all around us. And it’s great! But, as it’s widely commented in the agile community, it poses some specific challenges when implementing Scrum or other agile approaches. So now I will address some of the common challenges which you might face while working remotely.

### Remote Work Challenges

We are used to saying the Scrum is a perfect probe for organizations, as it will reliably discover all the dysfunctionalities. Since the pandemic has forced many of us to work remotely, this unique capability has been kicked into overdrive regarding working with remote teams. Here are just some of the challenges that scrum masters face when working in a remote environment:

1. Scrum masters can no longer rely on face-to-face conversations to identify problems within teams and lack physical clues to identify team members' reactions and emotional state.
<p align="center"> <img width="500" height="" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/875/0*IeW3tKiTEacEG3M0.jpg"></p>

2. Team members are unused to remote collaboration, so both individual and team productivity suffer. Face-to-face meetings at white-board or other planning practices need to be replaced.
3. Most of the practices and team organizing techniques that scrum masters relied on in the office have to be adapted or fully altered to stay effective in the remote environment.
4. Teams are harder to organize because there’s no more shared physical space to facilitate communication and coordination within teams.
5. The remote environment can be distracting, so it’s harder for a scrum master to keep everyone engaged during meetings.
6. Meetings can run too long and go off the rails due to personal chit-chat conversations, listening to irrelevant updates, or due to long decision-making processes.
7. Finding structure in chaos, It’s extremely easy to slide into chaos realm when dealing with software projects.
8. Coordinating across time zones.
9. Building rapport when everyone is not in the same office.

These are real problems. But not un-solvable ones. Let's walk through some strategies to help bridge the distance gap between local and remote offices, and ideas to help mitigate other potential issues as well.

### Tips for Remote Work

Agile has always been about colocation, about direct communication, physical boards, and all the other haptic and analog moments to create value in the digital realm. For your remote collaboration to work smoothly, you need a basic setup that offsets the distribution of team members. For starters, free tools are enough to get you started quickly.

**1. Keep sessions short:** No one can effectively follow more than 3 to 4 hours of online sessions per day. Preferably, reduce the session length to 2-hour blocks per day and include frequent breaks and activities that entice the engagement of the participants. Have regular breaks to allow for leg stretching, too.\
**2. Avoid hybrid meetings:** At the moment, the first remote team member joins, everyone joins the events via “dial-in,” too, no matter whether others are co-located or not. The reason for this is that a successful meeting requires an equal distribution of airtime and bandwidth among participants.\
**3. Be the first one:** As the facilitator of an event, be up & running 5-10 minutes early to ensure, that the setup is working — remember VPN and firewall issues — and those early attendees are admitted to the event and feel appreciated.\
**4. Working agreement:** Have a working agreement that addresses the basic rules of remote agile events such as mute yourself if you are not talking, or raise your hand if you want to talk, or that the video signal is always on. If the team is working remotely all the time, adding these to the team charter is a good practice. Otherwise, agree on the rules of the game at the beginning of the meeting.\
**5. Prep the team:** You cannot expect that they are familiar with all the tools you will be using during a virtual event. If they feel overwhelmed technically, they may cognitively drop out of the session. Alternatively, you may need to spend much more time on technical issues than planned. Both cases result in an inferior experience.\
**6. Privacy:** Discuss privacy or confidentiality issues in advance. For example, recording a video of a session might be a good idea if everyone is aware of it and not objecting. Otherwise, the idea of including everyone, giving them a voice, will fail from the start.\
**7. Be always on:** Be strict with the “video is always on” policy. If you allow avatars instead, people will hide behind them, probably becoming distracted by another task, they decide to tackle. Humans are bad at multi-tasking.\
**8. Workbooks:** Provide a briefing/workbook for your remote agile event in advance, detailing how to get access to the event technically, how to participate, its ground-rules, what preparation is expected from the participants, or providing the handouts the participants need for the planned session.\
**9. Time zones:** Be mindful of time zones. Spreading a session over more than 4 to 6 time zones is challenging.\
**10. Noise:** Make sure that attendees understand that it is vital for the success of the remote agile event that they participate from a quiet place, not the bean sack in the chill corner of the open office. No noise cancellation software can eliminate that level of background noise.\
**11. Chat:** Use a backchannel for group-wide and private communication, for example, the build-in chat of video-applications or Slack or MS Teams.

These were the important tips which as an SM  facilitating remote scrum events mean more preparation before a session and more documentation after the session. Talking about facilitation, let's see how to conduct the retrospective in a remote environment with some games.

### Remote Retro Games

The Sprint Retrospective is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. To read more on Sprint Retrospective click [here](https://github.com/Vaibhavpratapsingh22/Courses/blob/master/7-scrum-master-role/1-scrum.md).

I modeled the following design of a remote Retrospective is after the five stages of Esther Derby and Diana Larsen’s book “Agile Retrospectives:” I will explain each stages shortly with adding fun activities to it.

**1. Setting the Stage:** The setting should be such that regardless of what we discover, we understand that everyone did the best job he or she could.\
**2. Gathering Data:** This is often done by looking back and identifying what went well and what did not.\
**3. Generate Insight from the Data:** In this phase, teams typically identify why things happened and what should be done more, done less and tried out.\
**4. Deciding What to Do:** This includes deciding on specific, meaningful, agreed and realistic actions that will be done in the next Sprint.\
**5. Closing the Retrospective:** Don’t just walk away but close the retro with an activity.\

Remote retrospectives can be just as productive and profitable as retrospectives that take place on-site. As a moderator, you should think about how you can compensate for missing elements online.

## Summary

Working as a distributed scrum team is, in many aspects, more difficult than being co-located: ‘Reading the room’ is significantly more complicated, for example, and communication is taking a toll as the beloved informal meeting at the coffee machine is no longer happening. However, being suddenly distributed does not mean that we cannot have useful critical events anymore. On the contrary, The necessity to invest more preparatory work upfront may provide a chance to improving the meaning of events, and I would consider the remote Retrospective to be a prime candidate for that purpose.\
Tools that are necessary to conduct remote meetings has been reserved for the next chapter.
