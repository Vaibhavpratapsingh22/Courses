# Chapter 6 - Software Testing

Software testing is a necessary and important activity of the software development process. It is an expensive process and consumes one-third to one-half of the cost of the typical development project. Therefore, a proper strategy is required to carry out testing activities systematically and effectively.

Software Testing provides a framework or set of activities, which are essential for the success of the project. This may include planning,designing of test cases, execution of a program with test cases, interpretation of the outcome and finally collection and management of data. Effective software testing will contribute to:
1. Delivery of high quality of software products.
2. More satisfied users.
3. Lower maintenance cost.
4. More accurate and reliable results.

### The testing can be broadly divided into two forms:
1. **Verification Testing**: This is used for requirement verification, design verification, code verification during various phases.
2. **Validation Testing**: Validation testing is the process of evaluating a system at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies the specified requirements.

A Basic difference in Verification and Validation Testing is as shown:

## Software Testing Strategies
Software testing strategies integrates software test case design techniques into a well-planned series of steps that result in the successful construction of software. Any test strategy incorporate test planning, test case design, test execution, and the resultant data collection and evaluation.

 General characteristics of these strategies are:

1. **Testing begins at the module level and work outwards**: Test which are carried out, are done at the module level where major functionality is tested and it works towards the integration of the entire system.

2. **Different testing techniques are appropriate at different points in time**: Different testing techniques are to be used under different circumstances. circumstances mean the levels at which testing is being done.

3. **The developer of the software conducts testing and if the project is big then there is a testing team**: For a small project developer can do testing himself. If the project is at a large scale then they can hire a testing team.

4. **Debugging and testing are all together different processes**: As testing aims to find errors whereas debugging is the process of fixing those errors.

*In order to conduct a proper testing, the following order should be performed as shown:*

As shown above first unit testing is performed. Unit testing focuses on the individual module of the product. After this we perform integration testing. When modules are integrated into bigger problems then we see new errors often. After integration acceptance testing is performed which is comprise of system testing and validation testing.     

In validation testing requirements established as part of software requirements analysis are validated against the software that has been constructed. Finally we arrive at system testing where the software and system are tested as a whole.

The relation between phases and testing are shown below:

### Types of testing

1. **Unit Testing**: 
We know that the smallest unit of software design is a module. Unit testing is performed to check the functionality of these units. The primary goal of unit testing is to take the smallest unit of testable software and find out wether it works exactly as expected. Each unit or module is tested separately before these units or modules are integrated to build the overall system. Since the module are small in size individual programer can do testing on their respective modules. So unit testing is basically white box testing.

The following tests are performed during unit testing:
1. Module interface test
2. Local data structures
3. Boundary conditions
4. Independent paths
5. Error handling paths

2) **Integration Testing**: Unit testing ensures that all the modules have been tested and each of them work  properly and individually. Unit testing does not guarantee that when these modules will be integrated then also they will work fine. Integration testing uncovers errors that arises when modules are integrated to build the overall system.

There are two types of integration testing as follow:
1. Top-down integration
2. Bottom-up integration

3) **Validation testing**: Software validation is achieved through a series of black-box tests that demonstrate conformity with requirements. In validation testing, plan and procedures ensure that:
1. All functional requirements are fulfilled.
2. All the required characteristics are achieved.
3. Documentation is done correctly.

4) **System Testing**: System testing means testing the entire software. The goal of system testing is to see if the software meets its requirements. System testing includes a series of different tests to fully exercise the computer-based system. Although each test has a different phase, all work to verify that system elements have been properly integrated and perform allocated functions.

System testing involves the following types of testing:
1. Recovery testing 
2. Security testing
3. Stress testing
4. Performance testing

This chapter contains only the basics of software testing. If you like to study this topic in brief then you can see the separate software testing course that will be available soon.

## Summary

In this chapter we have studied the basics of software testing. We will study them in brief in the course software testing. In this we learned about software testing forms, its different strategies.
