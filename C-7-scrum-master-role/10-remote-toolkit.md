# Chapter 10 - Remote Toolkit

The options are truly endless when it comes to choosing tools for your remote team. After all, it's not a simple task to take an in-person office environment and recreate it virtually. From water cooler chats to daily stand-ups, many aspects of the traditional office need to be recreated so your team can work together with ease. We will see tools on Task management, some tools for how to do brainstorming remotely, and lastly, tools to facilitate meetings and retrospectives. For me what matters is choosing the tool which is the best fit for your team.\
So let's start with some tools that can help you manage your task.

## JIRA

[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/de/software/jira) Software is a powerful platform that combines issue collection and agile project management capabilities into a single application. This software is used for bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management. It helps you plan and organize tasks, workflows, and reports for your agile team more efficiently. So let's see Scrum in JIRA.\
As we saw in the [Ch.1](https://github.com/Vaibhavpratapsingh22/Courses/blob/master/7-scrum-master-role/1-scrum.md) What is Scrum? Scrum is a popular framework for implementing agile software development.\
In Scrum, the team builds the product in a series of iterative sprints. Jira Software provides tools to make it easy to track and schedule tasks and to monitor progress. It has been extensively tailored for agile and for Scrum. Let's see how it looks.

Now let's have a look at another Task management tool that is Trello.

## Trello

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is the one project management tool presenting complete visibility and extensive collaboration for teams of any enterprise. The tool contains certain cards and boards allowing for shared communication in the project. An enterprise can go with creating any number of cards, teams, and boards. The drag-and-drop scenario in Trello allows you to create and assign tasks easily, analyze project performance, and track entire project details in a streamlined manner. Enhanced flexibility in Trello makes the cards as either color-coded, filtered, archived, or labeled.

As Trello can share thoughts, feedback, or ask questions directly on cards, it lets you be away from updated status meetings. As Trello even syncs well with mobile devices too, corresponding team individuals can receive comment notification either in the desktop application, mobile, or via email. Moreover, Trello mobility delivers extensive performance on in the Slack platform thus allowing for the execution of any operation from any place.

### Jira vs Trello

Jira Software has been designed for managing software development tasks while Trello doesn’t have a particular focus. Why are they both so widely used by software development companies, and how are they compared? Let’s start from the main features these tools offer with pricing info.

As you might’ve noticed, when you take a step back and compare JIRA vs Trello, they are opposite extremes. While Trello is extremely easy to get started, use, and setup, it doesn’t have all the features a growing team would want to streamline their product development process. Its biggest drawback would be its lack of dedicated support to run sprints.\
If you are looking for a project management tool with an exhaustive set of features, then JIRA surely has the upper hand. However, its biggest disadvantage is its steep learning curve that often leaves developers a little more than just frustrated. In the end, it all depends on the organization's and team's requirements and thoughts to implement the one in their bounds.\
Now let's move forward with some tools like the digital whiteboards for team collaboration.

## Whiteboards

An online whiteboard helps you to facilitate your team activities when working online. Getting together around a whiteboard is the best way to develop and share ideas with lightning speed. Whiteboards are essential tools for brainstorming sessions and retrospectives. It boosts the efficiency of online meetings and ad hoc collaboration sessions. It helps foster the creativity of your teams when working digitally. Here we will discuss three whiteboarding tools available for online workshops: Miro, Mural, and Jamboard. Let's start with Miro.

### Miro

[Miro](https://miro.com/) is the online collaborative whiteboard platform. It is available on any device—and on the web. When you get started, you can choose from any number of templates (e.g., UX design, customer mapping, and retrospective), or just start with a standard blank whiteboard. And you're not limited to one template: You can add as many as you want to a board, using zoom and scroll to navigate through the various templates on the board. Then add shapes, text, and sticky notes (drag-and-drop) as needed. Want to read more about Miro click [here](https://miro.com/blog/using-miro-to-run-remote-meetings-workshops/).

<p align="center"> <img width="700" height="" src="https://miro.com/static/images/page/mr-index/index-experiment/meetings_and_workshops.png?001"></p>
Starting Price - $10.00/month/user

### Mural

[MURAL](https://www.mural.co/) is a comprehensive collaboration tool that you can use for a variety of purposes – from brainstorming ideas and hosting ice-breakers or team-building sessions, to planning a sprint project, to reflecting on your team’s progress. This app gives you templates to start your own personal or team mural, depending on the category you select. So, for example, if you’re trying to solve a problem, you can use templates based on tools such as Design Thinking, Scenario Analysis, or Feedback Grids. You can then add text, shapes, drawings, images or icons, and vote on and prioritize your ideas. It is particularly strong as a team tool, letting you create multiple "rooms" for your whiteboards, each with different permissions to limit access.

<p align="center"> <img width="700" height="" src="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5ddd9c3f2186308353fe682d/5ef215d86c35382ef88805f2_EnterpriseHero-Large.png"></p>

Remote teams who use MURAL for meetings, will love the digital version of some office staples, from timers (which you can use for focused ideation sprints) to chat boxes. It can be tough to share candid feedback in remote team meetings. That's why we love MURAL's timed voting session, where you can allot a number of votes to each collaborator. To vote, click on an object on your whiteboard. Every vote is anonymous and tallied automatically.

Starting Price - \$12.00/month/user

### Jamboard

Google’s [Jamboard](https://gsuite.google.com/products/jamboard/) is a digital whiteboard that allows multiple users to interact with it at the same time. Jamboard is a great tool for helping teams collaborate and build on ideas virtually. For example, if you’re working remotely and you have a Chrome browser or the Jamboard app, you can login to your Google account and use instantly, for free. You can use it to set up a collaborative space – or “Jam” – on which you can add text, sticky notes, drawings, and pictures. It also provides a nice “laser” function, which allows you to highlight specific areas of a Jam – much as you would in a face-to-face meeting using a laser pen.

Now let's talk about another very important software which enables people to collaborate in ways that haven't traditionally been possible that is GitHub.

## GitHub

If you are in a software development industry, then, most likely you have heard about [GitHub](https://github.com/), a repository hosting service for Git that also has a web-based graphical interface.\
GitHub, can be divided into the Git, and the Hub. The service includes access controls as well as several collaboration features like tools for basic task management and for all projects you handle. GitHub hosts your source code projects in a variety of different programming languages and keeps track of the various changes made to every iteration.\
So, the “Git” implies the version control system; a tool that allows developers to keep track of the constant revisions to their code. The “Hub” is the community of like-minded individuals who participate. It is all about the collaborative effort of the community, in reviewing, improving, and deriving new ideas from the uploaded code. To learn more about what is Git and GitHub click [here](https://github.com/Vaibhavpratapsingh22/Courses/tree/master/1-github).

Now moving to the next tool that is Funretro, this tool is specially designed to conduct sprint retrospectives in a Fun and engaging way to collaborate with your remote team and get better in what you do with a simple, intuitive and beautiful tool.

## Funretro

[Funretro](https://funretro.io/) is a fun retrospective ('retro' for short) tool you can use for your regular sprint session to discuss what went well and what didn't. You'll be able to easily identify obstacles and discuss ideas for improvements that will allow you to move forward unhindered. It’s also a great opportunity for everyone to see and understand the workflow and collaborations while addressing issues with this. There are a lot of benefits of using funretro, to check out click [here](https://funretro.io/).

## Summary

Remember, a remote team is as strong as the tools they have access to and the processes it has in place to support everyone to do their best work. Since every team is so unique, every team deserves their own unique toolkit. You can empower your team to help in the decision-making process, and watch how these applications soon become the new space for conference room brainstorms, Friday wrap-up meetings, and water cooler banter.
