# Searching
#### Searching for an element in the list is a process of checking wether the specified element is present in the list and determining the location of the desired element.

Types of searching :

* linear-seach
* binary-search
* breadth-first-search
* depth-first-search

One by one we will discuss about them and also write their pseudocode.

## 1. Linear Search

Linear search is a very simple search algorithm. In this type of search, a sequential search is made over all items one by one. Every item is checked and if a match is found then that particular item is returned, otherwise the search continues till the end of the data collection.

### Example
![linearsearch](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/data_structures_algorithms/images/linear_search.gif)


    Algorithm : Linear_Search(Arr,N,X)

    Here Arr is an array containing N elements
    X is the element searched. If search is succesful this element finds the location of X in the array otherwise the value 0 is returned.
    Step1->[Search the array]
           Repeat for I=1 to N
               If Arr[I]=X then
                   Return(I) and exit
              [End of if statement]
            [End of for loop]
    Step2-> [Element not found]
               Return(0)
    Step3-> Exit          

### Complexity
**Time complexity** - O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

**Space complexity** - O(1). 


## 2. Binary Search

Binary Search: Search a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Begin with an interval covering the whole array. If the value of the search key is less than the item in the middle of the interval, narrow the interval to the lower half. Otherwise narrow it to the upper half.

    Algorithm:Binary_Search(A,X,N)
    Here Arr is an array containing N elements
    X is the element searched. If search is succesful this element finds the location of X in the array otherwise the value 0 is returned.

    Step1->[Initialize variables]
           First:=1
           Last:=N
           Mid=(First+Last)/2
    Step2-> if X<Arr[mid]then
                 Last:=Mid-1
            Else
                 First:=Mid+1
                 [End of if statement]
    Step4-> Mid=(First+Last)/2
            [End of step 2 loop]          
    Step5-> if Arr[mid]=X then
                return(mid)
            Else
                return(0)
            [End of of statement]
    Step6->Exit                

### Complexity
**Time complexity** - Ðž(log n), where n is the number of items being sorted.

**Space complexity** - O(1), due to auxillary space only.

## 3.Breadth First Search
Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm that is used to graph data or searching tree or traversing structures. ... This algorithm selects a single node (initial or source point) in a graph and then visits all the nodes adjacent to the selected node. Remember, BFS accesses these nodes one by one.

![bfs](https://i1.wp.com/algorithms.tutorialhorizon.com/files/2015/05/Graph-BFS.gif)

    Algorithm : BFS(G,A)
    Given a graph G. This algorithm excecutes a breadth first traversal or searching beginning at a starting node. The variable STATUS tells us the current status of a node. Q is the name of Queue.

    Step1->[Initialize all nodes to ready state]
           Set STATUS =1 to all nides of graph G
    Step2->[Initialize first node and put it in
            the queue]
            [a] Insert starting node A in queue Q
            [b] Set STATUS =2 (waiting state) for a node A
    Step3-> [Repeat until all nodes have been
            examined]

    Step4-> [Process the Front node of queue Q]
            (a) Remove the front node , say N of queue Q
            (b)Process node N
            (c)Set STATUS= 3(Processed state) of Node N
    Step5-> [Add all neighbours of N in queue]
            (a)Insert all the neighbours of N in the queue Q
            (b) Change STATUS=2 (waiting state) all the neighbours of N
            [End of step 3 loop]
    Step6-> [Finished]
            Exit                    

### Complexity
**Time complexity** -The time complexity can be expressed as O(|V|+|E|), since every vertex and every edge will be explored in the worst case.|V| is the number of vertices and |E| is the number of edges in the graph. Note that O(|E|) may vary between O(1) and O(|V|^{2}), depending on how sparse the input graph is.

**Space complexity** - O(|V|), where |V| is the cardinality of the set of vertices (as said before). If the graph is represented by an adjacency list it occupies O(|V|+|E|) space in memory, while an adjacency matrix representation occupies O(|V|^{2})            

## 4. Depth First Search
Depth First Search (DFS) algorithm traverses a graph in a depthward motion and uses a stack to remember to get the next vertex to start a search, when a dead end occurs in any iteration

![DFS](https://www.codesdope.com/staticroot/images/algorithm/dfs.gif)

    Algorithm : DFT(G,A)
    Given a graph G. This algorithm excecutes a depth first traversal or searching beginning at a starting node. The variable STATUS tells us the current status of a node. S is the name of Stack.
    
    Step1->[Initialize all nodes to ready state]
           Set STATUS = 1 to all nodes of graph G
    Step2->[Initialize the first node and pull it 
           into the stack]
           (a)PUSH the starting node into the  
              stack S
           (b)Set the STATUS =2 (waiting state)
              for node A.
    Step3->[Repeat until all nodes have been
           examined]
           Repeat steps 4 and 5 until the stack 
           becomes empty
    Step4->[Process the TOP node of stack S]
           (a)Pop the top node,say N of stack S.
           (b)Process node N
           (c)Set STATUS =3 (Processed state of
              node N)
    Step5->[Add all theneighbours of N in  stack]
           (a)PUSH all the neighbours of N in the
              stack S.
           (b)Change STATUS =2 (waiting state) of 
              all the neighbours of node N.
           [End of step 3 loop]
    Step6->[Finished]
          Exit


## Complexity
**Time complexity** - O(V+E), where V and E are number of vertices and edges.
