# Chapter - 1 Setting Up Profile

It’s been several weeks or maybe months since you signed up as a freelancer on UpWork but you still haven’t had any luck landing a job. Sound familiar to you?

Having an incomplete freelancer profile or a profile with poor copy is one of the main reasons why most freelancers have a hard time landing clients on platforms like UpWork.

Because when you apply for a job on UpWork, the first thing your client do is checking your profile to learn more about you. And an incomplete or a bad profile might give your clients the wrong impression of you.

UpWork, Freelancer.com, People Per Hour, are all great freelance platforms you can use as a starting point for your freelance career. However, just registering an account and filling it up with some random text is not going to work out well for you.

If you’re serious about making a career as a freelancer, the first thing you need to do is create a complete and an attractive freelancer profile.

So, here’s what you should include in your UpWork freelancer profile:

## Attractive Headline
 Write a Headline That’s Clear, Concise and Effective
Your headline should get straight to the point. We recommend keeping it to one line, so you don’t get bogged down with jargon or superfluity. After all, you’ll have the opportunity to write about yourself with detail and flair in the profile itself. All you need to do is simply include the following three pieces of information:
1. Title
2. Years of experience
3. Specialty

With these three key elements, you’ll be able to communicate your basic qualifications and expertise—which is often enough to help you move past an initial glance from job posters.

## Share Your Qualifications and Experience
Aside from value, people are interested in learning about your background and your experience in your craft. In your freelance profile, be open to including your qualifications, technical skills and number of years in the field. Prove to prospective clients that you’re qualified, confident and enthusiastic to take on their project. If you hit all of their checkpoints, they’ll add you to the shortlist—one step closer to the job!

Here, include:
1. Your title (e.g., senior graphic designer)
2. Years of experience in the field
3. Areas of expertise and/or specialty
4. Technical skills and program knowledge
5. Industry expertise (if applicable)
6. Links to sample work
## Be Empathetic
Empathy is hugely valuable as a business owner. Why? You need to be able to give your clients what they want, need and value. What’s more, it needs to come from a genuine place. Showing empathy directly on your freelance profile has the potential to place you leaps and bounds ahead of your competition. It shows you care and, better yet, it shows you’re human.

## Make It Simple for People to Contact You
The easier you are to contact, the more reliable you’ll appear. After all, reliability is one of the most important factors for clients when hiring freelancers. They’re essentially putting their vision in your capable hands. If you’re adding your freelance profile to a job network, their terms may require you communicate within the platform. If that’s the case, don’t include external contact information to avoid getting penalized or banned from the site. These platforms were built to effectively handle communications.

## Create a Maintenance Plan
Your freelance profile isn’t a get-it-and-forget-it asset. It actually requires regular maintenance. Just as you would update your resume as you gain more experience or earn another certificate, you also need to freshen up your online profile. So revisit your profile every few months to refresh the copy or add any new credentials.

For freelancers, your digital profile is your resume. If you want to get paid, you must have the freelance profile to back it up. It’s what makes a good first impression, gets you the interview and helps you stand out from the competition.
