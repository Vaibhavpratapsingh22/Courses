# Chapter - 4 Bidding
Your application or bid is the first contact with the client, so it is very important to make a good first impression. Unfortunately, we often see freelancers waste a lot of potential with writing inappropriate and meaningless applications.

If you don’t get any responses from clients, then try using the following bidding tips to write “killer bids”. Here are 6 steps you can follow when sending an application as follow:

## Tip #1:  Introduce yourself to the client
At the beginning of your application, you should always briefly introduce yourself. Write your name, your job title, and your location. This will help to make your application sound more personal and the client will already get the most important details about you in the first sentence.

## Tip #2: Always read the project details beforehand
In every writing assignment, the specs are important. Included in the project details, the buyer specifies exactly what the project includes and what he expects the freelancer to accomplish.

In assessing the buyer’s job description, ask the following questions: Do you qualify for the niche? Can you write on the
topic with expertise? If you say Yes! on both counts, include relevant samples or references along with your bid.

## Tip #3: Convince the client with your skills
The most important thing that the client will look for in your application is if you as a freelancer know all the skills that are required for the project.

So this is the moment of truth and the most important part of your application. Name the required skills you fulfill and do not bore the client with unrequested information about programming languages, your company history, and other skills the client is not interested in. Keep it short and simple!

## Tip #4: Avoid scripted bid proposals
Scripted bid proposals sound too mechanical. The most INEXPERIENCED freelancers write hackneyed bid proposals. When your bid looks and sounds the same as all the other bids, you sound like you’re only interested in winning the project itself and not meeting your buyer’s standards and expectations.

Here is one more tip: Never just post a resume as a substitute for writing a competent, conversational bid proposal. Posting just a resume in reply to a job opening is a lazy (and foolish) way of showing you do not know how to address the buyer’s specific needs. Sure, you can post your resume as part of your portfolio or samples, but not as a way of addressing the buyer directly.

## Tip #5: Avoid being too hasty in committing your time
Although there’s a sense of urgency to bidding, you should never be too hasty. Never commit to a project unless you’re prepared to deliver. Since the element of time is a crucial factor, think ahead and plan your schedule in order to meet all your deadlines.

## Tip #6: Provide Links to Online Examples
It’s always a good idea to upload samples with your private message or provide links to online examples. Be sure, however, that your examples are appropriate for the job and represent your best work. Quality, not quantity is usually the rule of thumb when submitting samples.

## Tips For Writing Proposals
1. Use the first line to show that you’ve read their profile and understand what they need (instead of saying your name and talking about yourself).
2. Introduce yourself and explain why you’re an expert in what they need.
3. Make a recommendation or ask a question to reinforce the fact that you’re an expert in this topic.
4. Close with a Call to Action to get them to reply. Either ask for a website to learn more, or ask them when they’re available to talk.
5. Sign off with your name.
6. Keep everything brief. Aim for less than 120 words in your Upwork proposal. 85-100 words is ideal.

7. Use great spacing; you should only have two to three sentences MAXIMUM per paragraph in your proposal.
8. Only send proposals for jobs posted on Upwork within the last 24 hours. You’ll be more likely to get the interview if you do this.
9. Commit to sending out proposals five days per week (Monday – Friday) for at least a month to build up your leads on Upwork.
10. Price yourself near the top of the client’s range. Never compete on price and never try to be the cheapest.
Make sure you have a great Upwork profile that backs up everything you’re saying in your Upwork proposal.

1. Hello [Client Name], [If applicable: Thanks for the job invite.] It’s a pleasure to meet you. [Ask 3-4 short but relevant questions about the job here. This shows that you’ve read the description and know your stuff, and also invites the client to begin a conversation with you.]
