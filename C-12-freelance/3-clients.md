# Chapter - 3 Who is your Ideal Client

Before you can charge ahead and zone in on your target, you first need to have a solid handle on what exactly an ideal customer is. When you think about it this way, the entire concept is quite simple: "Your ideal customer is someone who gets their exact needs met by what you’re offering."

 So, your ideal client is someone who benefits from your product or service. But, it’s also defined as someone you most want to target with your marketing and promotions based on your current business situation. Perhaps you’ve been mainly reaching creative freelancers, but you’d rather shift your focus and work with more agency founders. Your existing customers may not necessarily be your ideal ones.

In a perfect world, your ideal customer will marry both of these aspects. They’re someone who sees tons of value in your product or service, but will also help push your business in the direction you want to go.

Now that you know what exactly defines an ideal customer, it’s time to get to work and reach them! How? Here are the steps you need to take:

## Step1: Look At Your Current Client Base

Rather than take a wild guess, take some time to work out the people you currently work with. If there are certain people you don't enjoy working with, exclude them from your list. Take some time to look at their gender, age bracket, industry, location and income level. Ask them what drew them to working with you. This can quickly give you a good overview of "who is your who."

## Step2: Use some good old-fashioned brainstorming
If your product or service is going to be successful, it’s going to have to solve a key problem your audience is facing. So, before you go any further, ask yourself this very important question: What specific problem am I trying to solve?

For instance, let’s say you’re a business coach. More specifically, you love to help small business owners learn effective sales strategies and techniques. In this situation, the main problems your potential clients are experiencing may be the inability to find or attract customers, the knowledge or skills to do online marketing, or perhaps the budget to outsource certain key tasks.

## Step3: Determine Your Goals
Once you’ve looked at your business through your customer’s eyes and identified who is currently buying from you, it’s time to determine what your goals are.

Are you happy with this current type of customer and, more importantly, are they happy with you? Or, do you feel that you’re not appropriately targeting the people who would value your business the most? For example, you’ve been working with a lot of startup founders, but would like to form partnerships with more enterprise-level companies.

As mentioned above, your current clients or customers may not be your ideal ones. Maybe you’ve noticed that your customer retention rate is really low—people are buying once, but not returning. Perhaps you’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of customer complaints. Or, maybe you just want to shift your focus, change your business model, and reach a totally different audience.\
This is the time to outline your goals. Determining what specifically you want to achieve will help you alter your strategies when it comes to your customers. 

## Step4: Create Trigger Phrases

Your clients don’t know how to solve their problems, but they usually know what their problems are. If you can get really good at demonstrating that what you sell is the answer to their problem they really don’t care what you call it.

Break down every solution you sell and every benefit you attribute to what you do, and map it back to a handful of “trigger phrases.” These phrases can be questions or statements or even anecdotes, but they must come from the point of view of the client.

## Step5: Remember Your Hard Work
So, you pulled together a detailed profile of your ideal customer and made sure everyone on your team was on the same page. Now what?

Unfortunately, many businesses make the mistake of putting all of the time and research in, and then just letting that information sit there unused. If your goal is to target those specific customers in order to continue improving your business, you need to always keep the information you gathered at the top of mind. It should influence every move and decision you make. So use the information wisely.

## Summary 
Identifying your ideal customer can seem like an overwhelming and daunting task. However, it’s an important step in growing and improving your business, and with these five steps, the process doesn’t need to be overly complicated. Follow along and you’re well on your way to not only reaching new customers—but the right ones.
