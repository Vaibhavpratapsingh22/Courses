# Chapter - 2 Making Strategy
Find one strategy that works really well, and then another, and then one more. Focus your primary efforts on developing strategies A and B simultaneously, and get to strategy C once the first two have been established. It’s important to understand that there isn’t one formula that works for all, certain freelancers will find strategy X to work great, while other freelancers will find strategy Y to work best.

Below are 5 strategies that should be kept in mind before bidding on a project.
## Strategy 1: Word of Mouth & Networking
If you're just getting started, it's important to build up your reputation and credibility. You do this by getting your first few projects completed, and making sure your clients are happy with your work.

Since you don't yet have credibility, and most people aren't familiar with your services, a good place to start is with your family, friends, and connections. Let them know what you're up to and ask if there's anything you can do to help. If your first few clients are happy with your work, they will be happy to recommend your services to their circle of friends.
## Strategy 2:  Reach Out to Friends and Family
Congrats, you’re in business, so tell people!

Advertise to your friends and family that you’ve got your own business up and running and you’re looking for work. At the very start, you might be able to cut a deal with people where you’ll do a bit of work for a reduced rate. That’s one way to get going in your freelance career.\
Here’s an example, set up a Facebook post that says something like:

"Hey everyone! For the last few months, I’ve been writing for law firms and have gotten really positive responses. I’d love to keep expanding my client base in this area. If you know anyone who has any law firm connections here, I’d love if you gave me a shoutout." 

Lots of times there will be a friend of a friend who happens to be in need of what you’re offering. So don’t be shy putting yourself out there. Your friends and family are going to be great allies in helping you get the word out.
## Strategy 3: Build an online portfolio
One thing a client looks for in a potential freelancer is whether you’ll be able to deliver. If you’re new to freelancing, there’s a 90% chance you’ll lose out on projects to a more experienced freelancer. Occasionally, though, a prospective client doesn’t just choose the most experience freelancer, but instead spends the time to review the profiles of other freelancers who offered to work at a lower rate.

Now you have a chance to convince the client that you are worth a try. To make a great impression with the client, you need to have a convincing portfolio. By portfolio, I don’t mean one with a lot of showy graphics and design. Good portfolios use a simple design and show off the best work you have done. If you have worked on some big projects at your daily job, put up some screen shots and a description of the project.

## Strategy 4: Contribute to open source projects
While many potential clients don’t have a software development background, others do, and these clients prefer freelancers with quality experience. Working on an open source project is an excellent way to establish your credibility with clients like these.

Contributing to open source projects gives you an advantage over other freelancers.
## Strategy 4: Good freelance hourly rate
Firstly, your hourly rate calculation should take into account any and all monthly costs and expenses that you as a freelancer might have. Start with Calculating expenses, take into account any and all costs from less obvious ones such as internet fees, website hosting, and software costs to more general costs such as rent, utilities, office equipment, legal and accounting, taxes, insurance, etc.\
 Then Calculate working days, it is advisable to determine how many days per week, month, or year you are looking to do freelance work.\
  After this, Calculate your Minimum Acceptable Rate (MAR) once you’ve calculated your expenses and working days, it’s time to set your MAR – or minimum acceptable rate. This is the absolute lowest hourly rate you would be willing to work for. By analyzing your costs and workdays, you can calculate the MAR that best works for you.
