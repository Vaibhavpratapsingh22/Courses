# Fork

A fork is a copy of a repository that allows you to freely experiment with changes without affecting the original project. A forked repository differs from a clone in that a connection exists between your fork and the original repository itself. In this way, your fork acts as a bridge between the original repository and your personal copy.

Forking a project is as easy as clicking the  Fork  button in the header of a repository. Once the process is complete, you’ll be taken right to your the forked copy of the project so you can start collaborating!
According to help.github.com, a ‘fork’ is a personal copy of another user's repository that lives on your GitHub account.

Forks allow you to freely make changes to a project without affecting the original, enabling limitless opportunities for experimentation and learning from other people’s work. 

A forked project also remains attached to the original, allowing you to submit a pull request to the original's author to update with your changes, ensuring you’re always working off a recent or up-to-date codebase.
