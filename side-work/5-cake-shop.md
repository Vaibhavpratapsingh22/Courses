# Cake Shop
My friend is going to start a new shop of cakes and pastries. I want to surprise him with a logo. 

So, I asked him generally that how he wants to see his logo, name he is going to keep for his shop. So he told me that the name will be "Cakewala" that sounds indian, after that he told that he wants a logo with a chef cap and a mustache. Then I made the logo as shown below:
