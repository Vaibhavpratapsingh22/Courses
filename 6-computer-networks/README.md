# Computer Networks - CCNA
A computer network is a group of devices connected with each other through a transmission medium such as wires, cables etc. These devices can be computers, printers, scanners, Fax machines etc. The purpose of having computer network is to send and receive data stored in other devices over the network.

## Chapter - 1  Introduction

We shall study about the definition of computer networks. Then we study in brief about data communication, networks, protocol and standards.

## Chapter - 2 Basic Concepts

Basic concepts includes topics like line configuration, types of network topologies and internetworks.

## Chapter - 3 The OSI Model

In this chapter we will study the OSI model and TCP/IP model.

## Chapter - 4 Transmission Media
The chapter will teach you about different types of transmission media, transmission impairment, Performance and shannon capacity. 


## Chapter - 5 Error Detection and Correction
Here we will study about types of errors that occurs in transmission of data and how to detect and correct them.

## Chapter - 6  Basics of IP Networking

In this chapter we will compare the types of models, protocols,architecture, cables and topologies that we have learned in the above chapters. Then we will also learn a new topic i.e IPv4 and Subnetting.

## Chapter - 7 LAN Switching

Here we will start with switching concepts like why they are called more intelligent then routers, how they store the MAC address of all nodes in the network. Then we will learn about ethernet the term which is used usually in the field of networking. After all this, we will see what are the troubleshoot interface and cable issues that occur in a network. At last, we will configure layer 2 protocols.

## Chapter - 8 IP Addressing



## Chapter - 9 Routing Protocols



## Chapter - 10 Troubleshooting
