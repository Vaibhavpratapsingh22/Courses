# Chapter - 4 Transmission Media
A transmission medium is something that can mediate the propagation of signals for the purposes of telecommunication.\
A communication channel that is used to carry the data from the transmitter to the receiver through the electromagnetic signals. The main function of this is to carry the data in the bits form through the Local Area Network (LAN). In data communication, it works like a physical path between the sender & the receiver. For instance, in a copper cable network the bits are available in the form of electrical signals whereas in a fiber network, the bits are available in the form of light pulses. The quality, as well as characteristics of data transmission, can be determined from the characteristics of medium & signal. The properties of different transmission media are delay, bandwidth, maintenance, cost, and easy installation.

There are two types of transmission medium and they are further divided as shown:

## 1. Guided Medium
Guided transmission media are also called bounded media or wired media. They comprise cables or wires through which data is transmitted. They are called guided since they provide a physical conduit from the sender device to the receiver device. The signal traveling through these media are bounded by the physical limits of the medium.\
Twisted-pair and coaxial cable use metallic (copper) conductors that accept and transport signals in the form of electric current. Optical fibre is a cable that accepts and transports signals in the form of light.

### Twisted Pair Cable
A twisted pair consists of two conductors(normally copper), each with its own plastic insulation, twisted together. One of these wires is used to carry signals to the receiver, and the other is used only as ground reference. The receiver uses the difference between the two. In addition to the signal sent by the sender on one of the wires, interference(noise) and crosstalk may affect both wires and create unwanted signals. If the two wires are parallel, the effect of these unwanted signals is not the same in both wires because they are at different locations relative to the noise or crosstalk sources. This results in a difference at the receiver.

Twisted Pair is of two types:

**1. Unshielded Twisted Pair (UTP)**: It is the most common type of telecommunication when compared with Shielded Twisted Pair Cable which consists of two conductors usually copper, each with its own colour plastic insulator. Identification is the reason behind coloured plastic insulation.

**2. Shielded Twisted Pair (STP)**: This cable has a metal foil or braided-mesh covering which encases each pair of insulated conductors. Electromagnetic noise penetration is prevented by metal casing.
